You think of death but the life seem scary.  I'm past the graveyard seein' people Hail Mary  I ain't chillin til' I'm out parachutin'.  Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds.  Twenty five thousand a piece.  Fuck streets!  Tryin' to own the island.  Forget about wilin'.  Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'.  If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'.

I wanna house in Africa,  in my back yard, Businesses surrounded by security guards, With a big ass club called \"Kim n Him\" And a crew full of dollars I can go spend with him.

An\\' I smiled an\\' said: \"I\\'ll have some of that.\" We sat there an\\' talked as an hour passed, Like old friends.  I saw a black an\\' white picture an\\' it caught my stare, It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said: \"That\\'s my Bonnie, \"Taken \\'bout a year after we were wed.\"  He said \"Spent five years in the bar, \"When the cancer took her from me. \"But I\\'ve been sober three years now, \"\\'Cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:  \"Was the sight of her holdin\\' my baby girl. \"The way she adored that string of pearls, \"I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl, \"Married his high school love.\" \"An\\' it\\'s a new tee-shirt saying: \\'I\\'m a Grandpa\\'. \"Bein\\' right there as our time got small, \"An\\' holdin\\' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up, \"Yeah, man, that\\'s the good stuff.\"  He said: \"When you get home, she\\'ll start to cry. \"When she says: \\'I\\'m sorry,\\' say: \\'So am I.\\' \"An\\' look into those eyes, so deep in love, \"An\\' drink it up. \"\\'Cos that\\'s the good stuff. \"That\\'s the good stuff.

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy Drivin my first love out to the levvy Livin life with no sense of time And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine Wishin time would stop right in its tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back  I used to rock all night long to \"Keep On Rockin Me Baby\" Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies I heard it today and I couldn\\'t help but sing along Cause everytime I hear that song....  I go back to the smell of an old gym floor The taste of salt on the Carolina shore After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall Growin up too fast and I do recall Wishin time would stop right in its tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back, I go back  We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives Takes us to another place and time  So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire And the smell of Sunday chicken after church And I go back to the loss of a real good friend And the sixteen summers I shared with him Now \"Only The Good Die Young\" stops me in my tracks Everytime I hear that song,   I go back.... To the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine I go back.... To watchin summer fade to fall Growin up too fast and I do recall... I go back....

[Verse 1 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] I don\\'t give a fuck \\'bout your fault or mishappenin\\'s, Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens, Kids clappin\\' love to spark the place, Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face, It\\'s a cold world, and this is ice, Half a mil\\' for the charm, nigga this is life. Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave. 10 years been legit they still figure me bad. As a youngin\\', I was too much to cope with. Why you think, mo\\'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit. Should\\'ve been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny... I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle, This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon\\' bubble. Came out the gate, no I didn\\'t flow Joe shit. Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.  [Chorus] Said my niggas don\\'t dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my niggas don\\'t dance, See we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.  [Verse 2 - Remy] R to the E\\'zzy\\', M to the whizz-i [Y], My arms stay breezy,  The Don\\'s stay fizz-i, Got a date at 8, I\\'m in the 740\\'fizz-i And I just bought a bike so I can ride til\\' I die, With a matchin\\' jacket, Bout\\' to cop me a mansion, My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin\\'. We gangsta, and gangstas don\\'t dance- we boogie, So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies. Listen we don\\'t pay admission, And bouncers don\\'t check us, And we walk around the metal detectors. And there really ain\\'t no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor, Reckless, check it, said it?! Like my necklace, started relaxin\\' now, that\\'s what the fuck I call a chain reaction. See, money ain\\'t a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed  now we \\'bout to change the game nigga.  [Chorus] Said my niggas don\\'t dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my niggas don\\'t dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.  [Verse 3 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] Now we livin\\' better now,  Gucci sweater now, And that G4 could fly through, any weather now, See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions. That\\'s why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin\\'s. Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit, Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit, If I visited Compton, they\\'d prolly squeel. \\'Cause half these rappers get \"Blow\" like Dereck Foreal. If you cross the line damn right, I\\'m gon\\' hurt you, These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials. Even Lil\\' Bow Wow throwin\\' it up, B2K crip walkin\\' like that\\'s what\\'s up. Kay keep tellin\\' me to speak about rucker, Matter of fact, I don\\'t wanna speak about the rucker, Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this, My niggas didn\\'t have to play to win the championship.  [Chorus] my niggas don\\'t dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my niggas don\\'t dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. '],\n",
