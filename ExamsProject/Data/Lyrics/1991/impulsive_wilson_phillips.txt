The secret of love
I thought I understood
The way it's supposed to be
I never imagined you could
Blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart

Chorus:
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart, it's beating 'Don't say no'
My head keeps saying 'Take it slow'

(Chorus)

You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous, woh
Ooh this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless... Impulsive

I never imagined you could
Blow my theory apart
But now you're running away... with my heart... my heart

(Chorus)

You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Wanna be impulsive... reckless
And lose myself in your kiss... woh

Impulsive
I wanna be... impulsive
I'm gonna be impulsive... reckless
And lose myself, lose myself
