Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams

Bryan Adams:
I finally found someone 
That knocks me off my feet 
I finally found the one 
That makes me feel complete. 

Barbra Streisand:
It started over coffee 
We started out as friends 
It's funny how from simple things 
The best things begin. 

Bryan Adams:
This time it's different 
And it's all because of you 
It's better than it's ever been 
'Cause we can talk it through 

Barbra Streisand:
My favorite line was 
 quot;Can I call you sometimes quot; 
It's all you had to say 
To take my breath away. 

CHORUS Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams:
This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone. 

Bryan Adams:
Did I keep you waiting 

Barbra Streisand:
I didn't mind 

Bryan Adams:
I apologize. 

Barbra Streisand:
Baby, that's fine 

Bryan Adams:
I would wait forever just to know 
You were mine. 
You know, I love your hair 
Are you sure it looks right 
I love what you wear 
Isn't it too tight 
You're exceptional 
Can't wait for the rest of my life. 

CHORUS Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams:
This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone.
