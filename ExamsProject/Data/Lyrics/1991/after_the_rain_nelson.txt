Look in the mirror girl, by now you should know 
You¡¯re living in a fantasy, and you can¡¯t let go 
He never really loved you from the start 
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart 
Don¡¯t be afraid to lose what was never meant to be 
After the rain washes away the tears 
And all the pain 
Only after the rain 
Can you live again 
I know the emptiness you feel inside 
You¡¯re thinking if you break away, you¡¯ll never survive 
I¡¯m waiting as my heart beats just for you 
Come on and take my hand and I¡¯ll pull you through 
But things will never change until you want them to 
After the rain washes away the tears 
And all the pain 
Only after the rain 
Can you live again 
You¡¯ll see the sun appear to light the way 
Only after the rain 
Can you hope to find true love again 
He never really loved you from the start 
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart 
Come on and take my hand and I¡¯ll pull you through 
You know the time has come for you to face the truth 
After the rain washes away the tears 
And all the pain 
Only after the rain 
Can you live again 
You¡¯ll see the sun appear to light the way 
Only after the rain 
Can you hope to find true love again 
After the rain
