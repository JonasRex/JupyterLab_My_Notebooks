So this is love, or so you tell me, as you're walkin' out the door
The months go by, and I know for certain, it's not the love I'm lookin' for

But sometimes just for a moment, I reach out, hope you're still there

Chorus:
Miles away, no you're never turnin' back and I just can't wait anymore
Miles away, nothing left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, you were miles away

It's hard to tell what you're going through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart and chances are, what you're feeling, I'm feeling too

If only just for a moment, hold on to the dreams that we had

chorus

When times were tough, and you were down and out, who was there by your side
Now you've gone, I'm so tired of being alone with only your promises

(Solo)

The loneliness just fades away, thoughts of you just memories
No cryin' now for what we're missin', time won't forget what you meant to me

If only just for a moment, hold on to the dreams that we had
