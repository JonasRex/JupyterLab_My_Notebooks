I am the one and only, 
Oh yeah! 
Call me, call me by my name or call me by number, 
Just put me through, 
I'll still be doing it the way I do it, 
And yet, you try to make me forget, 
Who I really am, don't tell me, I'd know best, 
I'm not the same as all the rest, 

Chorus: 
I am the one and only, 
Nobody I'd rather be, 
I am the one and only, 
You can't take that away from me 

I've been a player in the crowd scene, 
A flicker on the big screen, 
My soul embraces one more in a million faces, 
High hopes and aspirations, ideas above my station 
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride 

(Chorus) 

I can't wear this uniform without some compromises, 
Because you'll find out that we come, 
In different shapes and sizes, 
No one can be myself like I can, 
For this job I'm the best man, 
And while this may be true, you are the one and only you!
