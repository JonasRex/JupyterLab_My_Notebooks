I know it's late in your time
And we'd been talking for hours here
You don't have to tell me

I see that look in your eyes
And I know someone say goodbyes oh yeah
I feel it coming

And I hear you take a deep breath
And my hands are starting to sweat
I don't want you to
I don't want you to leave yeah

Stay here tonight stay here tonight
Just when you around me everything's right oh no
I don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms show you worth that's life oh no
I need you I need you

You crap your coat and I'm dying
But I know for years till deciding yeah
There's nobodies moving
Time stops and everything's quiet
I'm begging on for my life in you
You don't even see it

And then you coming closer
And baby it's not over
Till I hear you say till I hear you say
Goodnight oh yeah

Stay here tonight stay here tonight
Just when you around me everything's right oh no
I don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms show you worth that's life oh no
I need you I need you

Something about you saying is not
Something about you makes me feel like I'm nobody

Stay here tonight stay here tonight
Just when you around me everything's right oh no
Don't leave me alone

Stay here tonight stay here tonight
Just when you around me everything's right oh no
I don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms show you worth that's life oh no
I need you I need you

Stay with me tonight I need you Stay with me tonight I need you
Stay.. [fade out]
