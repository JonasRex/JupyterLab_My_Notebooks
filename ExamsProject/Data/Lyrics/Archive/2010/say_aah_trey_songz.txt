[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I make you say aah just like I'm your doctor
All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka
Then I'm tryna kick it play a lil socca
Then bust a couple off blocka blocka
The henny in your system you start drunk texting and suddenly you miss him
Or even wanna diss him
Then you call your girl like what the hell you gave me
She like don't blame me better do like Jamie
And blame it on the liquor
He works every time patron you my nigga

Well where your ass at
And I know you're thirsty but don't know where ya glass at
