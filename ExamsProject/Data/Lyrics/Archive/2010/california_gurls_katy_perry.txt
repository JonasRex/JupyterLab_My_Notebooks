Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Katy:]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek
(at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettoes
We freak
In my jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

[Snoop Dogg:]
Tone, tan
Fit and ready
Turn it up cause its gettin' heavy
Wild wild west coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her
Touch her
Squeeze her buns

The girl's a freak
She drive a jeep
In Laguna Beach
I'm okay
I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love LA
Venice beach
And Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys
Bangin' out
All that ass
Hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis
Martinis, no weenies
Just the King
And the Queeny
Katy my lady (yeah)
Lookie here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
Cuz you're representin' California (ohhh yeahh)
