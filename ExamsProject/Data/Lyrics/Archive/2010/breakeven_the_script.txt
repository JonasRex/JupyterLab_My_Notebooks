I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in 
Cos I got tI'me while she got freedom
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Her best days will be some of my worst 
She finally met a man thats gonna put her 1st
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven

What am I suppose to do when the best part of me was always you
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and your ok
I'm falling to pieces 
I'm falling to pieces 

They say bad things happen for a reason 
But not wise words gonna stop the bleeding
Cos she's moved on while I'm still grieving 
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven

What am I suppose to do when the best part of me was always you
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and your ok
I'm falling to pieces 
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other ones leaving
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, I took the blame. 
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains 
Cos you left me with no love, no love to my name. 

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in 
Cos I got tI'me while she got freedom
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even

What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and your ok
I'm falling to pieces 
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other ones leaving
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)
