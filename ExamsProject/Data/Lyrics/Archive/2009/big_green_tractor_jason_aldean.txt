She had a shiny little beamer with the ragtop down 
sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out 
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around 
And I just laughed and said yall get in 
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair 
She was looking to good not to go somewhere 
Said what'cha wanna do baby I don't care 
We can go to the show 
we can stay right here 
and I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor 
we can go slow or make it go faster 
down through the woods and out to the pasture 
long as I'm with you it really don't matter 
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to 
girl you know you got me to hold on to 
we can go to town or baby if you'd rather 
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor 
we can fire it up and I can show you around 
sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down 
when the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out 
we can turn on the lights and head back to the house 
or we can take another ride on my big green tractor 
we can go slow or make it go faster 
down through the woods and out to the pasture 
long as I'm with you it really don't matter 
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to 
girl you know you got me to hold on to 
we can go to town baby if you'd rather 
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor 
Just let me dust of the seat 
put your pretty little arms around me 
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to 
girl you know you got me to hold on to 
we can go to town or baby if you'd rather 
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor 
We can go to town or we can go another round 
On my big green tractor
