End of the Road,Boyz II Men,"[spoken]
Girl you know we belong together 
I have no time for you to be playing 
With my heart like this 
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see 

[verse]
We belong together 
And you that I'm right 
Why do you play with my heart, 
hy do you play with my mind 

Said we'd be forever 
Said it'd never die 
How could you love me and leave me 
And never say good-bye 

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight 
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry 
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead 
Spinnin' around and around 

[Chorus:]
Although we've come to the End Of The Road 
Still I can't let you go 
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 
Come to the End of the Road 
Still I can't let you go 
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 

Girl, I know you really love me, 
You just don't realize 
You've never been there before 
It's only your first time 

Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm 
Maybe you'll try 
We should be happy together 
Forever, you and I 

Can you love me again like you loved me before 
This time I want you to love me much more 
This time instead just come to my bed 
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down 

[Chorus]

[spoken]
Girl I'm here for you 
All those times of night when you just hurt me 
And just run out with that other fella 
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care 
You just don't understand how much I love you do you 
I'm here for you 

I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night 
Just like you did baby but that's all right 
Hey, I love you anyway 
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby 
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby 
Coz you just won't come back to me 
Will you Just come back to me 

(Lonely) 
Yes baby my heart is lonely 
(Lonely) 
My heart hurts baby 
(Lonely) 
Yes I feel pain too 
Baby please 

This time instead just come to my bed 
And baby just don't let me go 

[Chorus]

Baby Got Back,Sir Mix-a-Lot,"[Intro]
Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt. 
It is so big. *scoff* She looks like, 
one of those rap guys' girlfriends. 
But, y'know, who understands those rap guys *scoff* 
They only talk to her, because, 
she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay 
I mean, her butt, is just so big. *scoff* 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like, 
out there, I mean - gross. Look! 
She's just so ... black!

[Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes 
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupy
I've seen them dancin' 
The hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(LA face with Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

[Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Watchin' these bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}
If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!}
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
to do with my selection. 36-24-36 Ha ha, only if she's 5'3 quot;.

[Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups, 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that  quot;hard quot; role 
And tell you that the butt ain't go
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

(Little in the middle but she got much back) [4x]"
Jump,Kris Kross,
Save the Best for Last,Vanessa Williams,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
      Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
      I see the passion in your eyes
      Sometimes it's all a big surprise 
      'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
      You'd tell me this was love
      It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
      But somehow it's enough 

      And now we're standing face to face
      Isn't this world a crazy place
      Just when I thought our chance had passed
      You go and save the best for last 

      All of the nights you came to me
      When some silly girl had set you free
      You wondered how you'd make it through
      I wondered what was wrong with you 

      'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
      And share your dreams with me
      Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
      Is the one thing you can't see 

      And now we're standing face to face
      Isn't this world a crazy place
      Just when I thought our chance had passed
      You go and save the best for last 

      Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
      Is the one thing you can't see 

      Sometimes the snow comes down in June
      Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
      Just when I thought our chance had passed
      You go and save the best for last 

      You went and saved the best for last

Baby-Baby-Baby,TLC,"And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life

Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's O.K.
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this ""B"" ain't got no time for you

[Chorus:]
Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me (uh)
Won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Ohhhhhh

[Chorus]

Baby, baby, baby
Ain't got no time for the part-time lovin'

I gotta be loved
And that's O.K.

Cause if you're gonna get me off 
You got to love me deep
(Get me off)

Baby Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Well you want my heart
And all my time

Cause a girl like me
I won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Chorus]

I can have any man that I want to 
Time and place that I choose to
But I think you know that I'd rather be here with you

Yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to 
Just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, got to love me

[Chorus]

Baby, baby, baby
I want to 
Time and place that I choose to 
But I think you know that I'd rather be here with you (yeah)
That's actual and facutal
You're the one I seem to run back to"
Tears in Heaven,Eric Clapton,"Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven

I must be strong
And carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven.

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven

I'll find my way
Through night and day,
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven.

Time can bring you down,
Time can bend your knees.
Time can break your heart,
Have you begging please, begging please.

Beyond the door,
There's peace I'm sure,
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven.

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven

I must be strong
And carry on,
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven."
My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It),En Vogue,"I remember how it used to be You never were this nice
You can't fool me
Now you talkin'
Like you made a change
The more you talk
The more things sound the same
What makes you think
You can just walk back
Into her life
Without a good fight
I just sit back
And watch you make a fool of yourself
You're just wasting your time
repeat chorus eight times:No, you're never gonna get it, never ever gonna get it, my lovin'
Now you promise me
The moon and the stars
Save your breath
You won't get very far
Gave you many chances
To make changes
The only thing you changed
Was love to hate
It doesn't matter what you do
Or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way
Maybe next time
You'll give your woman a little respect
Then you won't be hearing her say that- 
repeat chorus two times
Doesn't matter what you do
Or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way
Maybe next time
You'll give your woman a little respect
Then you won't be hearing her say that-

Under the Bridge,Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all that way

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away"

Just Another Day,Jon Secada,"Morning alone
When you come home
I breath a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same
If you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long.

Why can't we stay together
Give me a reason
Give me a reason.

[Chorus]
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it trough the day without you
It's just another day

Making the time
Find the right lines
What do I have to tell you 

I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Give us a chance to make it.

Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong
I'm not that strong.

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it trough the day without you
I, I can't  resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you.

Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason.

[Chorus repeats]"
