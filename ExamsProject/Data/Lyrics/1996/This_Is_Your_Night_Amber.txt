Dah dah dah dah dad, ditita ta tay  
1-This is your night,  
Dancing free until the morning light  
Together forever 'cause, this is your night  
And everything is gonna be alright  
2-Aww yeah, so in love with you  
Aww yeah, it's too good to be true  
Aww yeah, feelin' so brand-new, aww yeah  
Eee-yeah, eee-yeah  
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
You captured my heart, you're the key to my life  
A vision of our love, that made me survive  
Regaining the mood, that we're in, it's so real  
It's time to move up, and to face what I feel, oohh  
(repeat 1, 2)  
Tonight with my spirits, the one that you call  
I'm ready to stand up, and ready to fall  
I can't find a way, so attracted by you  
Let me be your girl, and I'll be so true, ooh
