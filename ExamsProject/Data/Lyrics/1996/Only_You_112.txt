I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
Eh eh, eh eh,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
eh eh, eh eh,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
Check it out...

[Notorious B.I.G]
Je-sus the notorious just, 
Please us with your lyrical thesis, 
We just chillin,
Milk em top billin, 
Silk and pure linen, 
Me and little Cease, 
Malibu sea breeze, 
Dom P's, 
Palm trees, 
Cats lay in Pablo,
In milked out diablos, 
The Williest, 
Bitches be the silliest, 
The more I smoke, 
The smaller the phillie gets, 
Room 112 where the players dwell, 
To stash more cash than Burn and Hale, 
Inhale, 
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (feels good), 
Dig up in your middle like Monie (yeah), 
Don't know me,
But your settin up to blow me, 
Try to style, 
Fly up north with a homie (yes),
It's style is dondatta, 
Playas stay splurgin',
Game so tight,
They call it virgin...

[112]
Oh I need to know,
Where we stand,
Do we share this special thing called love,
I know I do, 
What about you,
I just can't get enough of the time...

I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,

[Chorus:]
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else, 
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life...

Every time I'm with you,
Never want it to come to an end (thought I told you that we won't stop),
You always make me so happy,
You'll always have a place in my heart...

I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,

[Mase]
Now you can hum all you want to, 
Cum all you want to, 
Money I'mma front you, 
Girl I wanna flaunt you, 
I'mma always want you, 
When nobody want you, 
If I die now my love will still haunt you, 
Mase ain't the one that will pay for your phone, 
Mase be the one that will take you home,
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone, 
All your nights alone,
I could make you moan, 
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce, 
Bad Boy get more money than you can count, 
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce, 
I'd do it to your cat for a large amount,
And when the beef come you know where to be found, 
Why I be around till the winner is announced (the winner is), 
So there ya go girl with thousands in ya palms,
Why you can't let by gones be by gones...

[112]
Where do I go,
What must I do,
If I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby,
Like I am the only one for you,

[Chorus]

[Puff Daddy]
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
Eh eh, eh eh,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
eh eh,
I thought I told you that we won't stop,
I thought I told you that we won't stop...
