Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer, I've been watching you

1-At night I think of you
  I want to be your lady baby
  If your game is on, give me a call, boo
  If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you
  (repeat) 

Everyday I pray my heart can win
Everynight I pray I can call you my man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you, I want you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I going out every weekend, just to see my boo again
(repeat 1)

Boy you got all I need from what I see
And boy everynight I am constantly thinking of you
(rpt 1...)
