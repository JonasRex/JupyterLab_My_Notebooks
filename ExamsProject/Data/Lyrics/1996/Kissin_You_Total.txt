Verse 1:
Don't matter who knows,
I don't care who sees,
Me thinking about you,
Makes my life complete.
And what I mean by that,
That my whole world changes,
You make me feel things,
That I've never felt,
I wanna kiss you.

Chorus 1:
Kissin' you is all that I've been thinking of,
Kissin' you is ooh, ooh.
Oh yeah, I wanna kiss you.
Kissin' you is all that I've been thinking of,
Kissin' you is ooh, ooh.

Verse 2:
When I'm with my friends,
I'm trying to figure out a way,
To leave them behind just to get back to you.
You're my best kept secret,
And that's the way I like it.
You're my pride and joy, boy,
That's why I'm dreaming of you.
I wanna kiss you,
Yeah, yeah.

Chorus 2:
Kissin' you is all that I've been thinking of,
Kissin' you is ooh, ohh.
Kissin' you is so good.
Kissin' you is all that I've been thinking of,
Kissin' you is ooh, ooh.
OhBridge:
You're my pride and joy,
You're my baby, boy.
People ask me how I feel 'bout you,
They ask me if I love you...yeah.
Am I crazy for you...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
