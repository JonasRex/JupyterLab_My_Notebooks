Doctors have come 
from distant cities 
just to see me 
stand over my bed 
disbelieving what they're seeing 

they say I must be one of the wonders 
of god's own creation 
and as far as the can see they can offer 
no explanation 

newspapers ask 
intimate questions 
what confessions 
they reach into my head 
to steal the glory 
of my story 

they say I must be one of the wonders 
of god's own creation 
and as far as the can see they can offer 
no explanation 

I believe 
fate smiled and destiny 
laughed as she came to my cradle 
"know this child will be able" 
laughed as my body she lifted 
"know this child will be gifted 
with love, with patience 
and with faith 
she'll make her way" 

people see me 
I'm a challenge 
to your balance 
I'm over your heads 
how I confound you 
and astound you 
to know I must be one of the wonders 
of god's own creation 
and as far as you can see you can offer me 
no explanation 

I believe 
fate smiled and destiny 
laughed as she came to my cradle 
"know this child will be able" 
laughed as she came to my mother 
"know this child will not suffer" 
laughed as my body she lifted 
"know this child will be gifted 
with love, with patience 
and with faith 
she'll make her way"
