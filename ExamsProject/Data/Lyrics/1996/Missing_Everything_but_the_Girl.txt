I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And pass your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were
Two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind
While you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you
Shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train
I ask
Why did I come again?
Can I confess
I've been hanging'round
Your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing
Since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on
And I miss you-
Like the deserts miss the rain
