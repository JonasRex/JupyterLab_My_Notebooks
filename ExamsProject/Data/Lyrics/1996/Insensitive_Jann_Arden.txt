How do you cool your lips 
after a summer's kiss 
how do you rid the sweat 
after the body bliss 
How do you turn your eyes 
from the romantic glare 
how do you block the sound 
of a voice you'd know anywhere 
Oh, I really should have known 
by the time you drove me home 
by the vagueness in your eyes 
casual good-byes 
by the chill in your embrace 
the expression on your face 
that told me 
you might have some advice to give 
on how to be 
insensitive 
How do you numb your skin 
after the warmest touch 
how do you slow your blood 
after the body rush 
how do you free your soul 
after you've found a friend 
how do you teach your heart 
it's a crime to fall in love again 
Oh, you probably won't remember me 
it's probably ancient history 
I'm one of the chosen few 
who went ahead and fell for you 
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch 
I fell too fast, I feel too much 
I thought that you might have 
some advice to give on how to be 
insensitive
