Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain With a ticket for a runaway trainAnd everything seems cut and dried, Day and night, earth and sky, Somehow I just don't believe it  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Bought a ticket for a runaway train Like a madman laughing at the rain A little out of touch, a little insane It's just easier than dealing with the pain  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Runaway train, never coming back Runaway train, tearing up the track Runaway train, burning in my veins I run away but it always seems the same "

1995,"You are appreciated   [Verse One: 2Pac]   When I was young me and my mama had beef  Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets  Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face  Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place  Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool  with the big boys, breakin all the rules  I shed tears with my baby sister  Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids  And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama  When things went wrong we'd blame mama  I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell  Huggin on my mama from a jail cell  And who'd think in elementary?  Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day  And runnin from the police, that's right  Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside  And even as a crack fiend, mama  You always was a black queen, mama  I finally understand  for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man  You always was committed  A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it  There's no way I can pay you back  But the plan is to show you that I understand  You are appreciated   [Chorus: Reggie Green   ""Sweet Franklin"" w/ 2Pac]   Lady...  Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady  Dear mama  Place no one above ya, sweet lady  You are appreciated  Don't cha know we love ya?   [second and third chorus, ""And dear mama"" instead of ""Dear mama""]   [Verse Two: 2Pac]   Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair  No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there  He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger  wouldn't let me feel for a stranger  They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along  I was lookin for a father he was gone  I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs  They showed a young brother love  I moved out and started really hangin  I needed money of my own so I started slangin  I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks  It feels good puttin money in your mailbox  I love payin rent when the rent's due  I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you  Cause when I was low you was there for me  And never left me alone because you cared for me  And I could see you comin home after work late  You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate  Ya just workin with the scraps you was given  And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin  But now the road got rough, you're alone  You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own  And there's no way I can pay you back  But my plan is to show you that I understand  You are appreciated   [Chorus]   [Verse Three: 2Pac]   Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama  I can always depend on my mama  And when it seems that I'm hopeless  You say the words that can get me back in focus  When I was sick as a little kid  To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did  And all my childhood memories  Are full of all the sweet things you did for me  And even though I act craaazy  I gotta thank the Lord that you made me  There are no words that can express how I feel  You never kept a secret, always stayed real  And I appreciate, how you raised me  And all the extra love that you gave me  I wish I could take the pain away  If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day  Everything will be alright if ya hold on  It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on  And there's no way I can pay you back  But my plan is to show you that I understand  You are appreciated   [Chorus]   Sweet lady  And dear mama   Dear mama  Lady [3X] "

1995,She sits alone by a lamppost  trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind  She says Dad's the one I love the most  but Stipe's not far behind  She lets me in  only tell me where's she's been  when she's had too much to drink  I say that I don't care I just run my hands  through her dark hair and I pray to God  you gotta help me fly away  And just:  Let her cry:if the tears fall down like rain  Let her sing:if it eases all her pain  Let her go:let her walk right out on me  And if the sun comes up tomorrow  Let her be:let her be.  This morning I woke up alone  found a note by the phone  saying maybe I'll be back some day  I wanted to look for you  You walked in I didn't know just what to do  so I sat back down had a beer and felt sorry for myself.

1995,A lonely mother gazing out of her window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam She'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helping At all 'cause he can't seem to keep His self out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money The best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me  [Chorus] Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and lakes that You're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way Or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Little precious has a natural obsession For temptation but he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is baby it's good to me One day he goes and takes a glimpse In the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn't know why 3 letters took him to his final resting place Y'all don't hear me  [Chorus]  I seen a rainbow yesterday But too many storms have come and gone Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray I pray all ten fade away Seldom praise Him for the sunny days  And like His promise is true Only my faith can undo The many chances I blew To bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes No more lonely cries My only bleedin' hope Is for the folk who can't cope Wit such an endurin' pain That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame For tootin' caine in your own vein What a shame You shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane And name this day in time For fallin' prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind  Dreams are hopeless aspirations In hopes of comin' true Believe in yourself The rest is up to me and you  [Chorus] 
1995,We don't even talk anymore And we don't even know what we argue about Don't even say I love you no more Cause sayin' how we feel is no longer allowed Some people will work things out And some just don't know how to change  Let's don't wait till the water runs dry We might watch our whole lives pass us by Let's don't wait till the water runs dry We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives Don't do it baby  Now they can see the tears in our eyes But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart Why do we hurt each other Why do we push love away  Let's don't wait till the water runs dry We might watch our whole lives pass us by Let's don't wait till the water runs dry We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives Don't do it baby

1996,"Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the time On a live wire right up off the street You and I should meet Junebug skipping like a stone With the headlights pointed at the dawn We were sure we'd never see an end to it all And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues And we don't know Just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below Double cross the vacant and the bored They're not sure just what we have in store Morphine city slippin dues down to see That we don't even care as restless as we are We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts And poured cement, lamented and assured To the lights and towns below Faster than the speed of sound Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope Justine never knew the rules, Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls No apologies ever need be made, I know you better than you fake it To see that we don't even care to shake these zipper blues And we don't know just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below The street heats the urgency of sound As you can see there's no one around "

Tell me am I very far?   Must of been late afternoon On our way the sun broke free of the clouds We count only blue cars Skip the cracks, in the street And ask many questions Like children often do We said,  Tell me all your thoughts on God?  'Cause I would really like to meet her. And ask her why we're who we are. Tell me all your thoughts on God, Cause I am on my way to see her. So tell me am I very far - Am I very far now?   Its getting cold picked up the pace How our shoes make hard noises in this place Our clothes are stained We pass many, cross eyed people And ask many questions Like children often do   Tell me all your thoughts on God? 'Cause I would really like to meet her. And ask her why we're who we are. Tell me all your thoughts on God? 'Cause I am on my way to see her. So tell me am I very far?  Am I very far now Am I very far now Am I very far now "

1996,"Sittin on a quarter 'p of hay Thangs is feelin good today. I'm tore up,from the floor up Sippin on some crown royal. Trippin,in a circle of wood Where everybody smoke they own bud. Good ole' hay How you feel today Fine,blowed and dandy. Silly like i'm hype off candy. Gotta big,thick chic named sandy. In the farm in the middle of the barn Where everybody's feelin crazy. I went to visit granny's house.  Now i see why don't nobody leave. We constantly,constantly,constantly smokin b's. Too blitzed to even shake it off But i still got my head up. Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn And get my big black peter sucked Pass the hay you silly slut, Blaze it up so i can hit that bud. Git me zoned and i'll be on. Cuz i love to smoke upon hay.  [chorus] Smokin on Haaayy in the middle of the barn. Smokin on Haaayy in the middle of the barn.  The hay got me goin through a stage And i just can't get enough. Smokin everyday I got some hay And you know i'm finna roll it up. Make a cloud I'm gonna take my mind away from all the Bullcrap. Bump my sounds Lay back and roll Mack to the freaks that's on the road. Sometimes i wonder  When i was blowed on the streets.  Anybody wanna step to me, I'ma see how rough they be. In this session,manifesting On myp's and q's Never snooze cause i refuse. Inhale,exhale the smell. Smokin hay all by myself. Wildstle,laughin loud. Wit my homies by my side. If somethin jump off let it ride On my square when time is live. Everybody throw it up Go to the barn and get some hay. When i get my choke on. Fool you know i'm smokin on......  Hay now hay We smokin up hay in the middle of the barn And i'm lit up Can't get up My eyes are red And my head is spinnin. Took another pull Ridin red bull Got the goofies, can't stop grinnin. Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids And we bout to get in em. Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at And everything funny. Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high Smokin all that hay with no money. Now truly this bitch wanna do me So i hit the 151bacardi She high like the sun  Thick like cornbread,and i'm ready to party. That hay got me so gotdamn horny But i don't like that tramp. The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps. And i got the munchies I need soul food. Collard greens or pinto beans. If you smoke hay like the conflict do, Then you know what the hell i mean.  [chorus]  Rollin down the block Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack. Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that Hay stack Back up on the scene from smokin herb, I creeped up on the wall and all i heard. Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in  The hay With a funky dime word. Couldn't be myself Couldn't smoke wit nobody else If i didn't pass it to the left. Nigga would have lost my breath. Open up the window 'fore i fall and faint But i can't Cause i roll around in dat barn ride. Rollin up the hootie hoo Roughest skin roller on dat west side. Nigga come on in I got some hay Won't you close dat barn door Nigga what you let them flies out for Ain't nobody to rich, we poor. Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn The flies keep us chokin. Thank you jesus christ For all the hay you're givin us Cause we'll keep on smokin'.  [chorus] "

1997,Lyrics by Bernie Taupin   Goodbye England's rose  May you ever grow in our hearts  You were the grace that placed itself  Where lives were torn apart  You called out to our country  And you whispered to those in pain  Now you belong to heaven  And the stars spell out your name   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned out long before  Your legend ever will   Loveliness we've lost  These empty days without your smile  This torch we'll always carry  For our nation's golden child  And even though we try  The truth brings us to tears  All our words cannot express  The joy you brought us through the years   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned our long before  Your legend ever will   Goodbye England's rose  May you ever grow in our hearts  You were the grace that placed itself  Where lives were torn apart  Goodbye England's rose  From a country lost without your soul  Who'll miss the wings of your compassion  More than you'll ever know   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And you footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned out long before  Your legend ever will 
1997,"If I can reach the stars, Pull one down for you, Shine it on my heart So you could see the truth:  That this love I have inside Is everything it seems. But for now I find It's only in my dreams.  And I can change the world, I will be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good, Baby if I could change the world.  And if I could be king, Even for a day, I'd take you as my queen; I'd have it no other way.  And our love would rule This kingdom we had made. Till then I'd be a fool, Wishing for the day...  That I can change the world, I would be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good, Baby if I could change the world. Baby if I could change the world.  I could change the world, I would be the sunlight in your universe. You would think my love was really something good, Baby if I could change the world. Baby if I could change the world. Baby if I could change the world. "

Well I guess what you say is true - I could never be the right kind of girl for you!  I could never be your woman... I could never be your woman! I could never be your woman... I could never be your woman!  When I saw my best friend yesterday, She said she never liked you from the start, Well me, I wish that I could claim the same, But you always knew you held my heart!  You're such a charming, handsome man, Now I think I finally understand! Is it in your jeans? I don't know! But I'll stay for hours -- that's for sure! Why did you play me this way?

1998,Lyrics by Bernie Taupin   Goodbye England's rose  May you ever grow in our hearts  You were the grace that placed itself  Where lives were torn apart  You called out to our country  And you whispered to those in pain  Now you belong to heaven  And the stars spell out your name   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned out long before  Your legend ever will   Loveliness we've lost  These empty days without your smile  This torch we'll always carry  For our nation's golden child  And even though we try  The truth brings us to tears  All our words cannot express  The joy you brought us through the years   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned our long before  Your legend ever will   Goodbye England's rose  May you ever grow in our hearts  You were the grace that placed itself  Where lives were torn apart  Goodbye England's rose  From a country lost without your soul  Who'll miss the wings of your compassion  More than you'll ever know   And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never fading with the sunset  When the rain set in  And you footsteps will always fall here  Along England's greenest hills  Your candle's burned out long before  Your legend ever will

1998,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain, You're always crazy like that. And I watched from my window, Always felt I was outside looking in on you. You're always the mysterious one with Dark eyes and careless hair, You were fashionably sensitive But too cool to care. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather.  (Pre-Chorus 1) Well in case you failed to notice, In case you failed to see, This is my heart bleeding before you, This is me down on my knees, and...  (Chorus) These foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. You're breaking my heart.  You're always brilliant in the morning, Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you. You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar.  Well, excuse me, coz I've mistaken you for somebody else, Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself.  You'd teach me of honest things, Things that were daring, things that were clean. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean. I hid my soiled hands behind my back. Somewhere along the line, I must've gone  Off track with you.  (Pre-Chorus 2) Well, excuse me, coz I've mistaken you for somebody else, Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself.  (Chorus) These foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. You're breaking my heart.  You took your coat off, Stood in the rain, You're always crazy like that. "

1998,"When in the springtime of the year When the trees are crowned with leaves When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew Are dressed in ribbons fair  When owls call the breathless moon In the blue veil of the night The shadows of the trees appear Amidst the lantern lightChorus: We've been rambling all the night And some time of this day Now returning back again We bring a garland gayWho will go down to those shady groves And summon the shadows there And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms In the springtime of the yearThe songs of birds seem to fill the wood That when the fiddler plays All their voices can be heard Long past their woodland daysChorusAnd so they linked their hands and danced Round in circles and in rows And so the journey of the night descends When all the shades are gone""A garland gay we bring you here And at your door we stand It is a sprout well budded out The work of our Lord's hand""Chorus (2x) "

Verse I think that you could be whatever you wanted to be If you could realize, all the dreams you have inside. Don't be afraid if you've got something to say, Just open up your heart and let it show you the way.  Chorus  Bridge Believe in yourself. Reach down inside. The love you find will set you free. Believe in yourself, you will come alive. Have faith in what you do. You'll make it through.  Chorus "

As long as we stand here waiting,  Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose!  How do we get there today  When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes!  Your clothes never wear as well the next day!  And your hair never falls in quite the same way!  But you never seem to run out of things to say!...

2001,"I pulled into the shopping center  And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother  Like ice cream melting they embraced  Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face  All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard  And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car  I wanted to tell him it would be ok  But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away   But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  I don't know why they say grown men don't cry   Keep having this dream about my old man  I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand  We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down  But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around  So many things I wanna say to him  But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind   But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry   I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife  And everything that I hold dear in my life  We say grace and thank the Lord  Got so much to be thankful for  Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says  ""I haven't had my story yet.""   And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that  When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,  ""I Love You Dad""   I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry "

2002,"Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...  Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin', tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama, i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye, no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...  [CHORUS]  Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin' your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

2002,"It was painted red the stripe was white It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her We put on a shine; put on a motor Built out of love, made for the water Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten A piece of my childhood that will never be forgotten  It was just on old plywood boat With a '75 Johnson with electric choke A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And I would turn her sharp And I would make her whine He'd say, ""you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"" Just a little lake across the Alabama line But I was king of the ocean When daddy let me drive  Just an old half ton shortbed ford My uncle bought new in '64 Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking A couple of burnt valves and he had it going He let me drive her when we'd haul off a load Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals Smiling like a hero that just received his medal  It was just an old hand-me-down Ford With a three-speed on the column and a dent in the door A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it mode me feel And I would press that clutch And I would keep it right And he'd say, ""a little slower son you're doing just fine"" Just a dirt rood with trash on each side But I was Mario Andretti When daddy let me drive  I'm grown up now three daughters of my own I let them drive my old Jeep across the pasture at our home Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file And pull out that old memory And think of me and smile and say  It was just an old worn out Jeep Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet A young girl two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And he'd say, ""turn it left and steer it right, Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine"" Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride But I was high on a mountain When daddy let me drive  When daddy let me drive  Oh he let me drive  Daddy let me drive  It's just an old plywood boat With a '75 Johnson with electric choke "

2002,"Well, me an' my lady had our first big fight, So I drove around 'til I saw the neon light. A corner bar, an it just seemed right. So I pulled up.  Not a soul around but the old bar keep, Down at the end an' looking half asleep. An he walked up, an' said : ""What'll it be"" I said: ""The good stuff.""  He didn't reach around for the whiskey; He didn't pour me a beer. His blue eyes kinda went misty, He said: ""You can't find that here.  ""'Cos it's the first long kiss on a second date. ""Momma's all worried when you get home late. ""And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate, ""'Cos your hands are shakin' so much. ""An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair. ""Eatin' burtn suppers the whole first year ""An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up. ""Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.""  He grabbed a carton of milk an' her poured a glass. An' I smiled an' said: ""I'll have some of that."" We sat there an' talked as an hour passed, Like old friends.  I saw a black an' white picture an' it caught my stare, It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said: ""That's my Bonnie, ""Taken 'bout a year after we were wed.""  He said ""Spent five years in the bar, ""When the cancer took her from me. ""But I've been sober three years now, ""'Cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:  ""Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl. ""The way she adored that string of pearls, ""I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl, ""Married his high school love."" ""An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'. ""Bein' right there as our time got small, ""An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up, ""Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.""  He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry. ""When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I.' ""An' look into those eyes, so deep in love, ""An' drink it up. ""'Cos that's the good stuff. ""That's the good stuff. "

2003,"[Verse 1]  Little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day  Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head  Now today seem strange  No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID  Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home  What's really goin' on I wanna know  So gimme a call and let's play no games  I'm playin', you want the plane  Don't point a finger over herre  I bought you a fur coat for your birthday  And this the things I get shorty  Over there you starin' mad   That I went out with them other chicks  I told you they ain't shit!  They were just some buddies from high school that I went to  Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em  But I called you up but you wasn't home  Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call  I'll be waitin' at home   [Chorus]  I'm so sick of being lonely  Every night while my man goes out with his homies  I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved  Sick of being lonely  Every night while my man goes out with his homies  I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved   [Interlude (sung)]  Any other night, you'd be at home waitin' on me, yeah   (What's goin' on)  Any other night, you'd be actin' like a bugaboo, ooh  (What's goin' on)  Any other night, you'd be callin' me, stallin' me, ha  (What's goin' on)  Any other night, I can guarantee a page from you, ooh  (What's goin' on)   [Verse 2]  Hmmm, but tonight seem different  Man, it's about this fishy (I'm so confused)  Cuz I ain't even get shhhh  My wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell  And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail  What's goin' on Yeah I know I'm wrong  For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'  Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin  But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected   [Chorus w/ad libs]   [Verse 3]  I'm so sick of bein' lon-  AHH, don't finish yo statement  You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement  Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go  Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles  Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller  From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy  Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones  Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me  Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'  With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'  Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'  Something so pretty as you at home alone  That's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon  Now, I never put nothin' before you  That's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon   [Chorus 2X] "
2003,"Verse #1  These ideas are nightmares for white parents  Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings  Like whatever they say has no bearing  Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing  To see him walking around with his headphones blaring  Alone in his own zone, and he dont care  He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out  When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin out  Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out  But if he ever saw him again, he'd prolly knock him out  His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back  Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap  He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap  His step-father hit him so he socked him back  And broke his nose, this house is a broken home  There's no control, he just lets his emotions go  Come on...   Chorus:  Sing with me now, sing for the year  Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  Sing with me now,just for today  Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away   Verse #2  Entertainment is danger, intertwine it with gansters  In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum  Only you're unholy, only have one homey  Only this gun, lonely, cuz don't anyone know me  But everybody just feels like they can relate  I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great  Or they can be great, or even worse, they can teach hate  Its like kids hang on every single statement we make  Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum  Now how the fuck did this metamorphasis happen?  From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'  To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass  But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you  Fans turn on you, attorney's all gonna turn it to  To get their hands on every dime you have  They want you to lose your mind every time you mad  So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon  You need to spew, dont hesitate to produce air-guns  Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me  Swiftly just to get me offa these streets quickly  But all their kids been listen'n to me religiously  So i'm signing cds while police fingerprint me  They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me  If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesnt make sense, Pete  It's all political, if my music is literal and i'm a criminal,  How the fuck can i raise a little girl?  I couldn't. i wouldn't be fit to  You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you!   Chorus   Verse #3  They say music can alter moods and talk to you  But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?  Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude  Just tell the judge it was my fault, and i'll get sued  See what these kids do, is hear about us toting pistols  And they want to get one, cos they think the shit's cool  Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves  We're entertainers, of course this shit's affecting our sales  You ignoramus. but music is reflection of self  We just explain it, and then we get our cheques in the mail  It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'  To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted  It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing  Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine  Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long  Idolise their favourite rappers and know all they songs  Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives  So they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die  Till they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe  We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes  That's why we sieze the moment, and try to freeze it and own it  Squeeze it and hold it, 'cos we consider these minutes golden  And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone  Just let our spirits live on, through out lyrics that you hear in our songs  And we can   Chorus   Chorus Without Beat   Instrumental "

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy Drivin my first love out to the levvy Livin life with no sense of time And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine Wishin time would stop right in its tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back  I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin Me Baby"" Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along Cause everytime I hear that song....  I go back to the smell of an old gym floor The taste of salt on the Carolina shore After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall Growin up too fast and I do recall Wishin time would stop right in its tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back, I go back  We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives Takes us to another place and time  So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire And the smell of Sunday chicken after church And I go back to the loss of a real good friend And the sixteen summers I shared with him Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks Everytime I hear that song,   I go back.... To the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine I go back.... To watchin summer fade to fall Growin up too fast and I do recall... I go back.... To the loss of a real good friend And the sixteen summers I shared with him... I go back... I go back... I go back "

[Verse 1 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's, Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens, Kids clappin' love to spark the place, Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face, It's a cold world, and this is ice, Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life. Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave. 10 years been legit they still figure me bad. As a youngin', I was too much to cope with. Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit. Should've been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny... I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle, This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble. Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit. Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.  [Chorus] Said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my niggas don't dance, See we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.  [Verse 2 - Remy] R to the E'zzy', M to the whizz-i [Y], My arms stay breezy,  The Don's stay fizz-i, Got a date at 8, I'm in the 740'fizz-i And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die, With a matchin' jacket, Bout' to cop me a mansion, My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'. We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie, So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies. Listen we don't pay admission, And bouncers don't check us, And we walk around the metal detectors. And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor, Reckless, check it, said it?! Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction. See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed  now we 'bout to change the game nigga.  [Chorus] Said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.  [Verse 3 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack] Now we livin' better now,  Gucci sweater now, And that G4 could fly through, any weather now, See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions. That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's. Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit, Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit, If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel. 'Cause half these rappers get ""Blow"" like Dereck Foreal. If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you, These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials. Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up, B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up. Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker, Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker, Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this, My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.  [Chorus] my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and, Do the Roc-away. Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

2004,"He said I was in my early 40's, With a lot of life before me,  And a moment came that stopped me on a dime. I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays, Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time. Asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real end. How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news. Man what ya do. And he says,  [Chorus]  I went sky divin',  I went rocky mountain climbin',  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fumanchu. And I loved deeper,  And I spoke sweeter,  And I gave forgiveness I've been denying,  And he said someday I hope you get the chance, To live like you were dyin'.  He said I was finally the husband,  That most the time I wasn't. And I became a friend a friend would like to have. And all the sudden goin' fishing,  Wasn't such an imposition. And I went three times that year I lost my dad. Well I finally read the good book, And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do If I could do it all again. And then.  [Chorus]  Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity To think about what you do with it, What could you do with it, what can I do with with it, what would I do with it.  [Chorus] Sky divin',  I went rocky mountain climbin',  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fumanchu. And I loved deeper,  And I spoke sweeter,  And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'. And he said someday I hope you get the chance, To live like you were dyin'.  To live like you were dyin'. To live like you were dyin'. To live like you were dyin'. To live like you were dyin'. "

I keep it flippin' like acrobats. That's why I pack a mack, that'll crack a back, cause on my waist, there's more heat than the shaq-attack! But I ain't speakin' about ballin', jus' thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start ballin'. We all in together now, birds of a feather now, jus' bought a plane so we changin' the weather now.

[x4]  See I caught him with a right hook, caught him with a jab, caught him with an upper cut, kicked him in his ass. Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk, and no trips to the county.. I ain't for that walk! We split like 2 pins at the end of a lane, we'll knock out your spotlight and put end to your fame. Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo' chain, and put the booty of a swish at the end of a flaamme.  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] Hey, you want WHAT with me?! I'm gonna tell you one time, don't FUCK with me! Get down! Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose, and I'm havin a bad day, don't make me take it out on you! [x2]  Maann, cause I don't wanna do that. I wanna have a good time and enjoy my Jack.. sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell, so I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell. I know it's been a little while since I've been out the house, but now I'm here.. you wanna stand around runnin' yo' mouth? I can't hear nothing you sayin' or spittin', so what's up? Don't you see we in the club?, man shut the fuck up!  [Chorus]  [Outro] Ah! We in the red light district! Ah! We in the red light district! Whoo! We in the red light district! Ah! We in the red light district! Whoo! We in the red light district! Whoo! The red light district! Whoo! The red light district.. Ah! The red light district.. "

2005,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.   Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.   Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea. They're swept away and nothing is what is seems, the feeling of belonging to your dreams.   Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.   And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been when love was wilder than the wind.  Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.   Listen to your heart, mm-mmmmmm  I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. "

You got me  Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney uncles crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream  [Chorus] Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright  It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at  your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment  [Chorus]  And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdies neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha) "

2005,"How long before I get in? Before it starts, before I begin? How long before you decide? Before I know what it feels like? Where To, where do I go? If you never try, then you'll never know. How long do I have to climb, Up on the side of this mountain of mine?  Look up, I look up at night, Planets are moving at the speed of light. Climb up, up in the trees, every chance that you get, is a chance you seize. How long am I gonna stand, with my head stuck under the sand? I'll start before I can stop, before I see things the right way up.  All that noise, and all that sound, All those places I got found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound, to show you how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground, if you could see it then you'd understand?  Ideas that you'll never find, All the inventors could never design. The buildings that you put up, Japan and China all lit up. The sign that I couldn't read, or a light that I couldn't see, some things you have to believe, but others are puzzles, puzzling me.  All that noise, and all that sound, All those places I got found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound, to show you how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground, if you could see it then you'd understand, ah when you see it then you'll understand?  All those signs, I knew what they meant. Some things you can invent. Some get made, and some get sent, Ooh? Birds go flying at the speed of sound, to show you how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground, if you could see it then you'd understand, ah, when you see it then you'll understand? "

2006,"Watch my life, Pass me by, In the rear view mirror Pictures frozen in time Are becoming clearer I don't wanna waste another day Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes  Yeah...  [Chorus] Cause I want you, And I feel you, Crawling underneath my skin Like a hunger, Like a burning, To find a place I've never been Now I'm broken, And I'm faded, I'm half the man I thought I would be: But you can have what's left of me  I've been dying inside, Little by little, No where to go, But going out of my mind In endless circles, Running from my self until, You gave me a reason for standing still  [Chorus]  It's falling faster, Barely breathing, Give me something, To believe in Tell me: It's not all in my head  Take what's left Of this man Make me whole Once again  [Chorus]  I've been dying inside you see I'm going out of my mind Out of my mind I'm just running in circles all the time Will you take what's left Will you take what's left Will you take what's left of me? Just running in circles in my mind Will you take what's left Will you take what's left Will you take what's left of me? "
2006,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house That don’t bother me I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while Even though going on with you gone still upsets me There are days every now and again I pretend I’m ok But that’s not what gets me  What hurts the most Was being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was tryin’ to do  It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go But I’m doin’ It It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone Still Harder Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret But I know if I could do it over I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart That I left unspoken  What hurts the most Is being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was trying to do  What hurts the most Is being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was trying to do  Not seeing that loving you That’s what I was trying to do "

2006,"[Introduction] Yeah... It's my life... My own words I guess...  [Verse 1] Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'her But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? ""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane ""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"" I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...  [Chorus] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...  [Verse 2] I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing ""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"" Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying ""You always say that, you always say this is the last time ""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"" She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it ""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on And I'm singing...  [Chorus] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...  [Verse 3] Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing ""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"" But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? ""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' ""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad ""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' ""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin ""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going"" But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice ""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"" That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say..  [Chorus/Outro] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...

She said ""Some days I feel like shit, Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"" I don't understand why you have to always be gone, I get along but the trips always feel so long, And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone, 'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone, But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call, But when I pick up I don't have much to say, So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up, That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin', Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career, Me and the rest of the family here singing ""Where'd you go?""  I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone. Where'd you go? I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone, Please come back home...  You know the place where you used to live, Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs, Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile, But now, you only stop by every once in a while, Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time, Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind, I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way, You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say, And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up, That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin', Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career, Me and the rest of the family here singing ""Where'd you go?""  I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone. Where'd you go? I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone, Please come back home...  I want you to know it's a little fucked up, That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin', Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses, For while you're not around, and feeling so useless, It seems one thing has been true all along, You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone, I guess I've had it with you and your career, When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it...  Where'd you go? I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone. Where'd you go? I miss you so, Seems like it's been forever, That you've been gone, Please come back home... Please come back home... Please come back home... Please come back home... Please come back home... "

Consider them my protégé, how much i think they should pay. Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way. I never been a hater still I love them, In a crazy way. Some say they so yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day. It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey. I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away. Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid. I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away. I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.

I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it. I do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy. The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing. Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in. Seems as though you lost sight of what’s important with the positive. And checks until your bank account and you up out of poverty. Your values is a disarrayed, prioritizing horribly. Unhappy with the riches cause your piss poor morally. Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning. And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?  [Rihanna:] You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.

2008,"I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing ""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become  Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world "
