Now there you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It′s only right that you should play it the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had

And what you lost

And what you had

And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they′re playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know,
You'll know, you′ll know

Now here I go again I see a crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It′s only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it′s raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you′ll know,
You'll know

All we had and all we lost
All we had and all we lost

Thunder only happens when it′s raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know,

All we had and all we lost

All we had and all we lost

All we had and all we lost

Thunder only happens when it′s raining
Players only love you when they′re playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know,
You′ll know, you'll know
(All we had and all we lost)
You′ll know, you'll know
(All we had and all we lost)
You′ll know, you'll know
(All we had and all we lost)
