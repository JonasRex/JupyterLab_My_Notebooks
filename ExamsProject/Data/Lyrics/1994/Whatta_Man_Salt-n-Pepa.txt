Yeah-yeah, ooh-yeah (ooh, uh)
Hey, hey
Alright (ooh-yeah)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (gotta say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (he′s a mighty-mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man (oh, uh)
What a mighty good man (yeah)

I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although, most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
′Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it, because it's just pathetic
To let it, get me involved in that "he said, she said" crowd

I know that ain′t nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y′all, he's worth it
So, here′s to the future, 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
Hahaha, you so crazy, I think I wanna have your baby (ow!)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (alright, yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (oh, he′s a mighty-mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (ooh-ooh)
What a mighty good man (you gotta say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (hey)

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep′
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep'
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn′t be him

He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he′ll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temp's
He′s not a fake wannabe trying to be a pimp
He dresses like a Dapper Don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Not to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See, other guys that I′ve had, they tried to play all that Mack shit
But every time they tried, I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he′s got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion

Yeah, the ritual, highway to Heaven
From 7 to 7, he's got me open like 7-11
And yes, it's me that he′s always choosing
With him, I′m never losing, and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (he′s a mighty-mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

I said, what a mighty good man (you know what I'm saying?)
He′s a mighty-mighty good man
Y'all don′t hear me? Now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a "Wham! Bam! Thank you, ma′am!" He′s a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose-pimples with every single touch

Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood ′cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter, and he′ll knock another out
Don't take him for a sucker ′cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful ′cause his mama taught him that (I got a good man)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (a mighty-mighty good man, baby)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (what a mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He′s a mighty-mighty good man
(Uh) what a mighty-mighty good man, yeah
(Uh) do me like that, sugar, yeah-hoo!
Now break it down, break it down, one time

What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man...
