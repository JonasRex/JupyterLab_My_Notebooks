I don′t know what you've been told
It ain't the butterfly, it′s the Tootsee roll
A brand new dance so
Grab a partner and get on the dance flo′
And work them hips a lil' bit
Then do that dip a lil′ bit
Oh yeah, you got it, no ifs, ands and no buts about it
And you over there, with the long hair

Keep rollin' that derriere
′Cause it ain't hard
Just a brand new dance for the 1990 Quad
