Party people!
Yeah, Tag Team music in full effect
That′s me DC the brain supremeAnd my man Steve Roll'n
We′re kicking the flow (we're kickin' the flow)
And it goes a little somethin′ like this

Tag Team back again, check and direct and let′s begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house, jump, jump, rejoice
There′s a party over here, a party over there
Wave your hands in the air, shake your derier
These three words when you're gettin′ busy
Whoomp! There it is, hit me

Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is

Upside down and inside out
I'm about to show all you folks
What′s it's all about
Now it's time for a nigga to get on the mic
And make this motherf- party hype
I′m taking it back to the old school
′Cause I'm an old fool who′s so cool
If you want to get down
I'ma show you the way, whoomp! There it is
Let me hear you say

Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is

Whoomp! Chak a laka chack a laka chak a laka chak a
Whoomp! Chak a laka chack a laka chak a laka chak a
Whoomp! Chak a laka chack a laka chak a laka chak a
Whoomp! Chak a laka chack a laka chak a laka chak a

Point blank, gin and juice I drank
Gettin′ bent and bent and as I puff on a dank
Rock a mic, uh-oh, I crave skin
Rip -, find a honey to to dip it in
Slam dunk it, stick it, flip it, and ride
That B double O-T-Y, oh my
Ooh, thats it come on, come on
Whoomp! There it is, I'm done

Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is

Hey! Hey-hey! (Whoomp! There it is)
Hey! Hey-hey! (Whoomp! There it is)

Some say I′m crazy, 'cause I'm pushin′ up daisies
The underground sound that you have found
Amazing, outstanding, demanding
Commanding you people dancin′ (woo!)
Sh- that's a breath taker, I produce AKA, the Undertaker
You want to come down to the underground old school
Here′s a shovel, can you dig it, fool?

Can you dig it? (We can dig it)
Can y'all dig it? (We can dig it)
Can you dig it? (We can dig it)
Can y′all dig it? (We can dig it)
Can you dig it? (We can dig it)
Can y'all dig it? (We can dig it)
Can you dig it? (We can dig it)
Can y′all dig it? (We can dig it)

W-H double O-M-P as I flow
To the fly shit from the school of old
Hardcore keep the folk lore wreck
Three to the two and one mic-check
Mad skill, flow ill on the mesh of steel
That's the grill of the microphone I just killed
Party people, it's your party, Tag Team is through
Whoomp! There it is, I thought you knew

Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is

Yeah, Tag Team music comin′ straight at ya
That′s me DC, the brain supreme
And my man Steve Roll'n
Bring it back, y′all bring it back, y'all bring it back
Here we go
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
Whoomp! There it is
