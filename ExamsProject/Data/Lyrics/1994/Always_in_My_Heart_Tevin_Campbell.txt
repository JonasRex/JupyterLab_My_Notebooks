Where do they get off telling you
That I am not the least bit into you
Just tell me how the hell the can tell youThey know what′s in my heart
What do they get from telling you
That I don't give a damn about you?

Wants to tear your heart apart

Why do them people have to tell you lies?
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show

Why do some people have to be that way?
I can′t take much more, I can't ignore

They′re not the ones to be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere
Be anywhere when things start falling down

They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can′t happen, it won′t happen
Girl as long as I'm around
