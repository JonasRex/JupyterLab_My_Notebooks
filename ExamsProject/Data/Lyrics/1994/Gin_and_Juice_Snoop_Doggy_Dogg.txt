With so much drama in the L.B.C.
It′s kinda hard bein′ Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky - like every single day
May I kick a lil′ something for the G's? (Yeah)
And, make a few ends as I breeze through (yeah)
Two in the mornin′ and the party's still jumpin′
'Cause my momma ain't home

I got - in the livin′ room gettin′ it on
And, they ain't leavin′ 'til six in the mornin′ (six in the mornin', six in the morning)
So what you wanna do?

So turn off the lights and close the doors
But, but what? We don′t love them - (yeah)
So we gon' smoke a - to this
G's up, - down, while you - bounce to this

Rollin′ down the street, smokin′ indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
(With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind)

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain′t chipped in
Now this type of - happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens, to the words that I speak

As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this - named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboys lady (oh, that bitch?)
80 degrees, when I tell that - "Please"
Raise up off these -, ′cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
- I′m just

Rollin' down the street, smokin′ indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)

And my money on my mind)

Later on that day, my homie
Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat - of some bubonic -
That made me choke, - this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm - up now

To serve me, not with a cherry on top
