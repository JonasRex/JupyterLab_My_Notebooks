No, I can′t forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goesYou always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can′t forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live, if living is without you
I can′t live, I can′t give any more
I can't live, if living is without you
I can′t live, I can't give any more

Well, I can′t forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can′t live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
I can′t live, if living is without you
I can′t live, I can't give any more

(No, I can′t live, no, I can't live) no, no, no, no
I can′t live (no, I can't live) if living is without you (no, I can′t live)
I can't live, I can't give any more
I can′t live (no, I can′t live, no, I can't live)
