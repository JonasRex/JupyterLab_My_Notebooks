We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn′t last
Now they wonder why we didn't last

We fell in love, it seemed so righteous
Couldn′t compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion
From people who don't know, who don′t know

We fell apart, the bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared, they didn′t help
Makes me wonder, should we blame ourselves?

So here we are, broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody said to let it end
Well it makes me wonder we can't let them win

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion
From people who don't know

If we′d only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we should've done
We′d both be here still making love

I wanna know that
That we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion
From people who don't know

And our feelings
Just aren′t feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don′t know
