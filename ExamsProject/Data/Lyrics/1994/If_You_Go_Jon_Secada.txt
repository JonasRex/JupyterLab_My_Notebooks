Taking a day at a time
Dealing with feelings I don′t wanna hide
Learning to love as I go, babyWithout taking you along for a ride

(Tried to find myself) Baby!
(Tried to find the truth)
(Get out from this shell)
Girl, I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care

If you go, say goodbye
There′ll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really want is you (is you!)
Yeah, yeah!

Sorry if you felt misled, hey yeah!
But I know what I feel
I know what I said, baby
God! I hope you believe
Believe in all that we can be
The future in us, together in love

(You're the reason I′m strong) You′re the reason!
(Don't you think I don′t know)
(This is where I belong)
Give me the time
To say that you're mine, to say that you′re mine!

(If you go) If you go!
(Say goodbye) Say goodbye!
(There'll be something missing in my life) In my life!
(′Cause you know)
That all I really want is you (you)
All I really want is you!

(If you go, say goodbye) Say goodbye!
(There'll be something missing in my life) In my life!
('Cause you know) ′Cause you know!
That all I really want is you! (you)
Oh, I!

No, oooh, ooh, ooh, I...!

(Tried to find myself) Tried to find myself!
(Tried to find the truth) Tried to find myself!
(Get out from this shell)
Girl, I′m almost there
So let me show you, so let me show you!

(If you go, say goodbye) Oh...!
(There'll be something missing in my life) In my life!
(′Cause you know) Baby!
(That all I really want is you) (you)
Baby, yeah!

(If you go, say goodbye) Say goodbye!
(There'll be something missing in my life) In my life!
(′Cause you know) Baby!
(That all I really want is you) (you) All I really, all I really want!
All I really want is you!

(If you go, say goodbye) All I really want is you!
(There'll be something missing in my life) In my life, hey yeah!
(′Cause you know that all I really want is you) (you) Don't you know?
