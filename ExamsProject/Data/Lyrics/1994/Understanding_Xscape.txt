What I need from you is understanding
How can we communicate
If you don′t hear what I say (mmm... mmm... mmm... mmm...)What I need from you is understanding
So simple as one, two, three
Understanding is what we need

You don't even know me
You just wanna do what you wanna do
That′s not the way it should be, no
You should listen to me, boy (you better listen to me, boy)

I try so very hard
To make you understand
But the choices you make
Baby, they're old to me, ooh

I try so very hard
To keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

There′s no way that we can work it out
If we don′t pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (ooh...)
How can we communicate (mmm... mmm... mmm...)
If you don′t hear what I say
What I need from you is understanding (mmm... hmm...)
So simple as one, two, three (yeah)
Understanding is what we need

I listen to you, baby
And I know the things you're goin′ through
I try to understand
That's why I′m still with you, baby (I'm still with you)

See, every day we're living
Is one thing will always be unsure
That′s why I need you, baby, pleading, baby
Please let our love endure

I try so very hard
To keep our love alive
But you don′t wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

And there's no way that we can work it out
If we don′t pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (all I need, babe, is understanding)
How can we communicate
If you don′t hear what I say (you don't hear what I say)
What I need from you is understanding (all I need from you, baby)

So simple as one, two, three (can′t you see, one, two, three, mmm)
Understanding is what we need
All I need, all I need
All need is understanding
How
If you don't hear what I say
Can't you see, baby

Ooh
I try so very hard
To keep our love alive (yes, I do)
But you don′t wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

There′s no way that we can work it out if we don't pull together
I don′t mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you is understanding (understanding)
How can we communicate (now how can we communicate)
If you don't hear what I say (please hear what I say, yeah)

What I need from you is understanding (come on, baby, come on)
So simple as one, two, three (it′s so simple as one, two, three)
Understanding is what we need

If you don't hear what I say (oh)

So simple as one, two, three (ooh... oh)
