My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body′s telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobodyBut there is something that I must confess to you (Woo)

I don′t see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
(With a little bump and grind)
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don′t see nothing wrong, hey, whoa, let me hear you

See I know just what you want
And I know just what you need, girl
So baby, bring your body to me (Bring your body here)
I′m not fooling around with you, huh
Baby, my love is true (With you)
With you is where I want to be

Girl, you need someone
Someone like me, yeah
To satisfy your every need

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don′t see nothing wrong, baby, baby, I don't see, woo
I don′t see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey, huh

You say he′s not treating you right
Lady, spend the night
I'll love you like you need to be loved
Girl, won't you try some of me
No need to look no more
Because I′ve opened up my doors
You′ll never
You'll never want another love
You′ll never find another me

You see, you need someone, someone like me, yeah
To make love to you, baby, constantly

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don′t see nothing wrong, oh, whoa
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don′t see nothing wrong, baby, baby, alright

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong (I don′t see, I don′t see, nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don′t see nothing wrong (Nothing wrong, nothing wrong, nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
