Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
It′s plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope U are in these arms of mine

And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after U all one can do is die
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World

Could U be
It′s plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes U are
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours

I can try but when I do I see U and I′m devoured
Oh Yes
Who′d allow, who'd allow a face 2 be soft as a flower
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power

Oh Yes
Could U be (Could U be)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could U be

It′s plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes U are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be 2 far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty the kind that comes from inside
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
So beautiful, beautiful
It′s plain 2 see (Plain 2 see)
U're the reason that God made a girl
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
(U U′re my girl)
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
(U′re the reason)
If the stars (Could U be) ever fell one by one from the sky
(The Most Beautiful Girl in the World)
Oh Yeah
I know Mars (It′s plain 2 see) could not be 2 far behind
(U're the reason that God made a girl)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could U...
