It′s kind of easy when you listen to the g-dub sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo′ yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G

Can I get in where I fit in? Sit in, listen
Let me conversate better yet regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
′Cause I don′t like to dream about gettin paid
I played ball through the halls, of c-i-s
With Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him dirty left
Rack ′em up crack 'em up stack em up against the gate
The homies tryna catch me but they can′t, wait

The street lights just came on!
And my momma's in the streets tellin′ me to come home
I hit the gate and I hops on my schwinn
And I tell the homies, "Aight then," yeah

Verse two, now what the fuck I do?
Catch the bus to Cal' state, or chill with the voltron crew?
And make a few ends on the side
Here comes a baby blue van, time to ride
So Ii hops in the van with my nigga tick
And baby poppa back then, that was my click
We groovi' to santa anna
And we plan-on, make a hellafied mount of money

And what I did for extra fee
Was break niggas after work playin′ get like me
I was 14 years old, havin′ a sack
Just a young motherfucker eatin' valupaks
Shootin′ dice in the corners of the public schools
And I used to gangbang, but now it's a g thang

And I still know how to make those ends
You don′t believe me? Go ask the twins motherfucker
