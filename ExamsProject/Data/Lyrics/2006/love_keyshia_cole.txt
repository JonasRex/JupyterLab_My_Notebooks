[Keyshia talking]
Can I come Over & chill?
I want to talk to you for a minute.

When we met (we took our time)
Want to talk to ya (for a little while)
It seems we have so much in common yeahh,
and a piece of mind it what I get when im with you,
I cant wait until I see your face again
(I guess thats why)

[Chorus]
There aint no telling where this love could end up
(see boy you'll never know) maybe baby we could see.
There aint no telling where this love could end up
(up, up, up, up) see baby I was thinking

Maybe nex time (we can watch a movie together)
Just enjoy each other company
(I want to look into your eyes)
See what you're all about (what kind of things you like)
take our time, dont rush, but dont want to take it slow
I guess thats why aaaa

[Chorus]
There aint no telling where this love could end up
(see boy you'll never know) maybe baby we could see.
There aint no telling where this love could end up
(up, up, up, up) Everday ooo

Do you know you make smile when I need a voice everytime
to come around, I get this, I get this funny feeling maybe that
(maybe that we could see) apparently we feel each other and all I i i
(I dont want this feeling to go away) so baby (so baby say say that)

[Chorus]

Ooooooooo

[Chorus]

Ooooo

See you never knowwww
