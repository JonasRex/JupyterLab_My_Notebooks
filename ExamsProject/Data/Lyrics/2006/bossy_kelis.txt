[Too Short] 
Ya know 
It's a hard pill to swallow 
When they tell you you strange 
And you aint hot 
But in the blink of an eye 
They got on what you got 
That means I'm a Boss! 

[Kelis & Too Short] 
Uh, uh 
Watch the beat go 

[Kelis] 
I'm Bossy! 
I'm the first girl to scream on the track 
I switched up the beat of the drum 
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard 
And that's right I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm.... 

I'm Bossy 
I'm the chick y'all love to hate 
I'm the chick that's raisin' stakes 
I told Young Stunna he should switch to bass 
I'm back wit an 808, cause I'm bossy 

Ooo lemme slow it down so you can catch the flow(catch the flow) 
Screw it up, make it go extra slow (extra slow) 
Real girls get down on the floor (on the floor get down) 
If i gave you a taste you want some more 
Touchdown on me ... like a pro 
I'd rather be like a bicycle 
I'm icy cold 

ooo from the 6'4 hoppas up in Crenshaw 
the money-makin playas up in Harlem 
don't want no problems 
we gon' keep it pumpin' 
while the 808's jumpin' 

diamonds on ma neck d- diamonds on ma grill 
diamonds on ma neck d- diamonds on ma grill 

I'm Bossy 
I'm the first girl to scream on the track

(Oh, I bet, I bet, I bet) I Betcha never heard it like this before 
Me and my baby be closin' them phantom doors 
At the bar poppin this that u can't afford (can't afford) 
That u can't afford 

i'm chokin' 
Lost in the clowds it's all smokin' 
All the while i'm all open 
Me and ma girls we stay fly 
And we love to stay high 

Ooo from the 6'4 hoppas up in Crenshaw 
The money-makin playas up in Harlem 
Don't want no problems 
We gon' keep it pumpin' 
While the 808 is jumpin' 

Diamonds on ma neck d- diamonds on ma grill 
Diamonds on ma neck d- diamonds on ma grill

Damn girl- don't hurt him

What u want girl?

That's how you do it huh? 
Well I'm the coolest one 
Them bad bitches in the back, bring 'em to the front 
Tell that man, you's a bossy... 
Make some noise if you's a bossy... 
I don't think he understand you's a bossy… 
get some help if he can cause he lost it 
'Aint no refunds, she spent the cash man 
in your Benz wit her friends, in the fast lane 
Flossin'. You said, “how much it cost me?” 
About a million dollars playa; she's bossy
