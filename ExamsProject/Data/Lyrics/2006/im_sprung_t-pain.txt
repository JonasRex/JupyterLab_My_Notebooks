She got me doin da dishes 
Anythang she want for some kisses 
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry 
All she do is actin like she want me 
She cuttin off all my homies 
Even all my other ronnies 
She ain't even my main lady 
See I been thinking 'bout it lately 
Man she really don't deserve me 
All she wanna do is hurt me 
So I gotta get away from her... 
But now I'm leaving quickly 
Before she come and try to get me... 
And I'm takin everythang with me... 
Well it all come down to her...

[verse 2]
So we went our separate ways... 
It's been a couple of days... 
But now I'm doin what I want to 
With nobody tellin me what I'm gonna do 
And I'm feeling so free... 
With nobody but me... 
Now I can handle all my business 
All my fellas can I get a witness 
But I'm feelin kinda lonely 
On top of that I'm kinda horny 
And I gotta get back to her... 
Now I'm leavin quickly... 
Before she come and try to get me... 
And I'm takin everythang with me... 
Well it all come down to her... 

[chorus x2]
