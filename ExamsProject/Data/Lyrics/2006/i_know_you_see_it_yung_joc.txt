Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thong (thong)
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone (with my phone)
She love my cologne, I call it perk body zone (body zone)

Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her "get another round" (another round)
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground (the ground)
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down (button down)
And then I'm like "oh (oh) boy (boy), a clique fulla stars (stars)"
Big four fifth, big dick, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done (done)
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one (one)
