I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybodies breaking up
And Throwing their love away
but i know i got a good thing right here
That's why I say (Hey)

Nobody gonna love me better
I'm a stick wit u 
Forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'm a stick wit u
You know how to appreciate me
I'm a stick wit u
My baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'm a stick wit u

I don't wanna go another day 
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride
In our private lives
Ain't nobody getting in between
I want you to know that you're the only one for me
that's why i say

Nobody gonna love me better
I'm a stick wit u 
Forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'm a stick wit u 
You know how to appreciate me
I'm a stick wit u 
My baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'm a stick wit u 

And now
Ain't nothing else I can need
And now
I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you
Baby i'm with you, baby you're with me

So don't you worry about 
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts
So don't you worry about 
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's, that's why I say (Hey)

Nobody gonna love me better
I'm a stick wit u

Nobody's gonna take me higher
