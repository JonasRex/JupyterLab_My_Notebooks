Now, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's ok
And you don't care about me
And I know there's just no use
When all your lies become your truth 
and I don't care... yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye 
And tell me that you're happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased, 
Are you happy now? 
Are you happy now? 

You took all there was to take, 
And left me with an empty plate 
And you don't care about it, yeah. 
And I have given up this game 
I'm leaving you with all the blame 
Cause I don't care, yeah, yeah yeah,

Could you look me in the eye? 
And tell me that you're happy now, oohh oohhh
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased, 
Are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
Are you happy now?

Do you have everything you want?
You could never give something you aint got
You can't run away from yourself

Could you look me in the eye? 
and tell me that you`re happy now, oohh oohhh
come on tell it to my face or have i been erased, 
are you happy now? Ohhh, ohhhh
are you happy now?

Would you look me in the eye?
Could you look me in the eye?
I've had that all I can take
And I'm about to break
Cause I'm happy now, ohhh, ohhh
Are you happy now?
