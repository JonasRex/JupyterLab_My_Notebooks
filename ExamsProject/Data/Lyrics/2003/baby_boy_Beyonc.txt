I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
Baby boy not a day goes by without my fantasies(bay,bay,bay)
I think about you all the time I see you in my dreams

Picture us dancin real close
In a dark dark corner of a basement party
Every time I close my eyes
It's like everyone left but you and me

In our own little world
The music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea
Feels like true paradise to me
