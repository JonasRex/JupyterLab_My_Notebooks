See I've been watching you 
For a while your smile and stuff
And I don't know if I can be with you 
For tonight alright
Is that alright baby, baby

There is only one for me
You have made that a possibility
We could take that step to see, ohh
If this is really gonna be 
All you gotta do is say yes

All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me 
So so so so so so so so
You make me so so so so so so so so

Loving you has taken time taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognize the butterflies inside me
Sex is gonna be made tonight tonight
All you gotta do is say yes

[Chorus]
