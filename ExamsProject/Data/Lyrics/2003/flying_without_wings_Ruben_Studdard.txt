[Verso 1]
Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be
Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lovers eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

[Verso 2]
Some find the cheer in every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it the works of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry
You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your lives
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings

[Ponte]
So impossible as they may seem
You've got to find for every dream
'Cuz who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

[Verso 3]
But for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunlight on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place
It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you smile
And it's the flying without wings
'Cuz you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings
You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings 
I'm flying without wings
