When the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait when a moment can banish so fast
Cuz every kiss is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that it's what heaven is, well you'd be right
I've been waiting forever
For this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that it's what heaven is, well you'd be right
Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the end of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever
And hold on to tomorrow's beginning
After tonight we will never be lonely again

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me it's what heaven is, well you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the end of the earth and we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
THIS IS THE NIGHT
