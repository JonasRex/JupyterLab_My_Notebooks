[The Game:]
You can find me in tha a bay bay
Buckin full of cry-stale V.I.Ped up
Goin hard in body tap where they throw that cheeze up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You dont like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
Im tha king of this rap shit what the fuck they talkin bout
Niggas cant sell records so they blame it on tha South
I be all through Shreve-port Louisiana ballin
Like who the fuck said aint no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinnin like a world-wind
Pull up at the club bitches textin they girlfriends
They know who i is they know who i am
I be flyin through the south in that burgundy land
Pull up at the light my shit so bright
She want my number shit call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

[Hurricane Chris:]
Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E Get em up, Get em up, Get em up like
A bay bay thats what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check ima gone spend it up
On the bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when i pull up
And my pants sag low like i was rockin a pull-up
When i stop and i pull up ima be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain ima snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost i dont thank they on my level
Lil mama thank ima bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning im finna run tha game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talkin but heavy itenary break up yo chest if you runnin yo mouth
And every since i dropped that a bay bay i been runnin the South

Im in tha club hollerin
a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay

[Jadakiss:]
Yo look at any game 50 large is what I came with

This aint reggie miller ma this is cush and haze mixed
Don't sit there and lie to me you aint never taste this
Hope the Lord forgive me gave my Jesus piece a face-lift
Stones is doin the y-toosie in the bracelet
Aint no stopping that I be where the gwap is at
Excuse me I be wherever its poppin at

Every bunny with an arms reach wanna touch kiss
Yes and when I leave they all following just cuz I was in the club hollerin

A bay bay, a bay bay
