i love to see you in your sweater girl
i love you in your high tall boots
i love to see you in your sweater girl
love to see you walking that cute, you know it
i love to see you in your leather skin
love your lipstick on my sheets
and i love to see you in your alligator shoes
reciting to me my poetry, i really do but
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
i hate to see you doing that stuff
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
really hate to see you doing that stuff
i love you baby when you bite my ear
i don't worry about your uptown geek
and i love you baby don't you bite your lip
'cause it's me you talk to in your sleep and
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
i hate to see you doing that stuff
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
really hate to see you doing that stuff
i love to see you in your sweater girl
love your alligator chic
et je sais te vois dans ton christian la croix
but i hate to see you walking my street, but
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
i hate to see you doing that stuff
i hate to see you baby doing that stuff
