It's 5:30 in the mornin', good mornin'
I'm gon' and I'm yawnin'
I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I'm touchin' and rubbin'
Call me, call me, my darlin', my darlin'
Called you 7 times baby girl don't stall me
I wanna kiss u from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in ya cheek, ya tattoo on your belly ring
conversation underneath the sheet
U know me, redbull like a energy, Imma freak

Yeah, girl u know I put it down like a vet
Say the sound of my deep voice make us sweat
U call me 5 am on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' bout u from the bottom to the top
Picture this, u say u comin' over
30 minutes later u was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met u at the do'
3 seconds in the house and ya panties on the flo
Kiss you on ya mouth and ya hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Overdose on this love, stretch marks on my chest
Satisfied guaranteed with the playboy spec
