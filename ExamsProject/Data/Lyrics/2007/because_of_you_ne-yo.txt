[Verse 1:]
Want to, but I can’t help it
I love the way it feels,
It’s got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don’t
Tell myself I’ll stop everyday, knowin’ that I wont

[Bridge:]
I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don’t know if I walk away of it, but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know that much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, i’m so strung out on you
Babyboo, but I like it

[Chorus:]
And it’s all because of you [3X]
And it’s all because…
Never givin’ up,
She’s the sweetest touch

[Verse 2:]
Think of it every second
I thinkin of it but, 
Only concern is the next time, I’m gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cuz she’s no good for me
I tried and tried but my obsession wont let me leave

[Bridge:]
I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don’t know if I walk away of it, but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know that much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, i’m so strung out on you
Babyboo, but I like it

[Chorus:]
And it’s all because of you [3X]
And it’s all because…
Never givin’ up,
She’s the sweetest touch

Ain’t no doubt, so strung out [2X]
Over you, over you, over you

Because of you, 
And it’s all because of you,
Never givin’ up
She’s the sweetest touch, she’s the sweetest tooouch
