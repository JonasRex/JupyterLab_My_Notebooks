[Keyshia Cole & T.I.]
You need to get if he don't wanna (Aye, Aye, Keyshia Cole)
Love you the right way he ain't gonna (Aye, Aye, Grand Hustle)
It ain't where he's at its where he (you know me--it's the King)
Where he wanna be (Young Dro, Aight now, REMIX)

[Young Dro]
Face it
I'm racin around wit lil shawty
See me at the mall bustin it down wit lil shawty
I took her out to Cabo and shot that Balenciago(?)
I showed her how that (?) looked in the Gallardo(?)
Why tho
My girl she be makin me feel right
I mess around wit shawty she be makin me feel like
I can have somethin so we bond and let it go
But after while you gon' have to go on and let it go

[Keyshia Cole]
I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me

[Hook 1]
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be

[Chorus]
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go (If he aint gonna)
If he ain't gonna treat you 
The way he should
Then let it go (If he aint gonna)

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

[Missy Elliott]
When this song come on in the club
They gon be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gon drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They gon mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me and Keyshia won't stop
Til the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot (REMIX)

[Keyshia Cole]
See you been tryna make me feel like
You don't love me anymore
And you been tryna make me feel that
You don't need me anymore
But baby I won't let you play games
You wanna leave then you can go
I know ya heard (Grand Hustle)
It aint where he's at (Grand Hustle)
It's where he wanna be (Grand Hustle)

[T.I.]
(Aye, Aye, Aye)
My phone stay ringing
Even though my girl got a ten-carat ring and the stone stay blingin
Them hoes stay schemin
I see it in they eye when I'm leanin in the ride cuz the chrome stay  blingin
See 'em champaign wishin
Cavaiar dreamin 
To kick it with the king they all really are feenin
So they lie for no reason
Drops all hatin
Wishin they was in ya situation 
So that's why we take two vacations
One wit all the kids
Then one with all the strippers that ya crew stay chasin
Chillin in the cane 
Far away from fame 
And all the other situations weighin heavy on the brain
And now we margarita drinking
Champaign poppin
All night pool parties
Got big thangs poppin
6 G's in the pool
Just get naked 'fore you hop in
Topsand bottles
Hoes spots just hotta(?), Aye

[Chorus]
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should

Then let it go
If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

[Missy Elliott]
(Hands up in the air)
When this song come on in the club
They gon be like
Damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gon drop they tops like
Damn that's hot
They gon mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like
Damn that's hot
Me Kim and Keyshia don't stop
Til the tick don't tock like
Damn that's hot (that's hot that's hot that's hot)
