[Verse: 1]
Pull up your pants
(Just Like Em')
Take out the trash
(Just Like Em')
You can dig cash like em'
Fast like em'
Girl you outta act like ya dig
(What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
Vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
(Joint Account)
And another one he don't know about

[Hook]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?...
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corna roll'n
Do'n my own thing
Ohh

[Chorus]
What if I?...
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up?...
Or would they still apply?...
If I played you like a toy?...
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

[Guy Chopped & Screwed Voice]
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!

[Verse: 2]
Girl go head and be...
(Just Like Em')
Go run the streets
(Just Like Em')
come home late say sleep like em'
Creep like em'
Front with ya friends
Act hard when you're with em' like em'
(What)
Keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
Always keep an anti-alibi
(Keep Him In The Dark)
What he don't know won't break his heart

[Hook]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?...
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corna roll'n
Do'n my own thing
Yea

[Chorus]
What if I?...
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up?...
Or would they still apply?...
If I played you like a toy?...
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

[Guy Chopped & Screwed Voice]
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!

[Bridge]
If I was always gone
With the sun get'n home
(Would Ya Like That?)
Told you I was with my crew
When I knew it wasn't true
(Would Ya Like That?)
If I act like you
Walk A mile off in yo shoes
(Would Ya Like That?)
I'm mess'n with your head again
Dose of your own medicine

[Chorus]
What if I?...
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up?...
Or would they still apply?...
If I played you like a toy?...
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

[Guy Chopped & Screwed Voice]
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!

[Music Plays]

[Outro]
If I played you...
Would yo like that?
Had friends...
Would you like that?
Nother car?
Would you like that?
Hell naw
You wouldn't like that
No!

[Half-Chorus]
What if I made ya cry!
Would they still apply!
What if I...
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy!
