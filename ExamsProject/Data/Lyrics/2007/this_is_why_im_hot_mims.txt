[Verse 1:]
This is why I'm hot
I dont gotta rap
I can sell a mill sayin nothin on da track
I represent New York
I got it on ma back
And dey say dat we lost it
So I'ma bring it back
I luv da Dirty, Dirty
Cuz niggaz show me luv
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit da club
But in da Midwest
Dey luv to take it slow
So when I hit da H
I watch you get it on da floor
And if you needed it hyphy
I take it to da Bay
Frisco to Sac-town
Dey do it eryday
Coppin a Hollywood
As soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in dat Low, Low
I do it da Cali way
And when I hit Chi
People say dat I'm fly
Dey like da way I dress dey like
(Dey like my) my attire move crowds from side to side
Dey ask me how I do it and simply i repy...

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
This is why I'm hot
Catch me on da block
Every otha day
Another bitch another drop
16 bars, 24 pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there drivin cars 
Push 'em off da lot
I'm into shuttin stores down so i can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell me wat you need you know i get 'em by da flock
I call ma homie black meet on da ave
I hit wash with da money in da bag
We into big spinners
See my pimpin never dragged
Find me wit different women dat you niggaz never had
For those who say dey know me know I'm focused on ma cream
playa you come between you'd better focus on da beam
I keep it so mean da way you see me lean
And when say I'm hot my nigga dis is what I mean

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
This is why I'm hot
Shorty see da drop
Ask me wat I paidd and I say yea I paid a quap
And den I hit da switch dat take away da top
So chicks 'round da way dey call me cream of da crop
Dey hop in da car
I tell 'em all bout
We hit da studio dey say dey like da way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em and dey tell me dat'z their song
Dey say I'm da bomb
Dey luv da way da charm hangin from da neck
And compliments da arm which compliments da ear den comes da gear
So when I hit da room da shortyz stop and stare
Den niggaz start to hate rearrange thier face
Little do dey know I keep 'em things by waistside
I reply nobody gotta die
Simliar to Lil wizzy cuz I got dat fire

[Chorus:]
