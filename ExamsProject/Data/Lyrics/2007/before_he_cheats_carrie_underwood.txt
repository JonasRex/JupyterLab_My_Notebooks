Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp, 
and she's probably getting frisky... 
right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey... 

Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to shoot a combo... 

And he don't know... 

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive, 
carved my name into his leather seat... 
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights, 
slashed a hole in all 4 tires... 

And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats. 

Right now, she's probably up singing some 
white-trash version of Shania karoke.. 
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk" 
and he's a thinking that he's gonna lucky, 
Right now, he's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom Polo... 
And he don't know... 

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive, 
carved my name into his leather seat, 
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights, 
slashed a hole in all 4 tires... 

And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats. 

I might saved a little trouble for the next girl, 
Cause the next time that he cheats... 

Oh, you know it won't be on me! 

Ohh... not on me... 
Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive, 
carved my name into his leather seat... 
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights, 
slashed a hole in all 4 tires... 

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats. 

Ohh.. Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats... 

Ohh... before he cheats...
