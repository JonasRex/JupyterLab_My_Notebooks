All or nothing - push.
All or nothing - push - girl, let it be.

Night after night it starts the same
talking with my baby on lovers lane.
You're real sweet and all a glow,
turn me on and then you're ready to go.

I ask her: Baby, can I walk you home?
She says: Yes, okay, I hate to be alone.
I'm dreaming, you're smiling,
you're my girl,
my only fantasy in this world.

Nothing is wrong with being in love,
it's a wonderful feeling from heaven above.
Squeeze me, please me, turn me on,
I love you so much,
you can never go wrong.

I like your smile, I like your touch,
all or nothing, cause I want you so much.
I'm longing for your tender kiss,
Baby, I wanna tell you this:

All or nothing - push - it's got to be,
something's gotta show when you're living under heat.
All or nothing - push - girl, let it be,
take it from a pro who's rocking to the beat.

I'm under heat, oh baby, please, take it slow,
give me some time and maybe our love will grow.
I wanna suit you, baby, and make it right,
take it from me, baby, I wanna rock all night.

If it's good for me it's good for you, you gotta never let your mood get dry,
just keep it wet and my 740 jet is pushing right on high.
You're the girl of my dream and you're making me hot,
you're looking good, you're too hot to trot.

I wanna be with you through all the hours
and shower you with all my flowers.
I like your smile, I like your touch,
all or nothing, cause I want you so much.
I'm longing for your tender kiss,
baby, I wanna tell you this:

All or nothing - push - it's got to be, ...

I'm under heat, oh baby, please, take it slow, ...

All or nothing - push - it's got to be, ...
