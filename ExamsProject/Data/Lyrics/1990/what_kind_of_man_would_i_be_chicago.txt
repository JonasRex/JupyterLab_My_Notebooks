Girl, well it's been one of those days again, 
and it seems like the harder I try, 
over and over, I'm right back where I began; 
but you understand. 
Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right, 
oh I just want to run to you. 
You pull me through. 
Oh baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their life? 
Tell me: What kind of man would I be, 
living a life without any meaning? 
And I know you could surely survive without me, 
but if I had to live without you, 
tell me what kind of man would I be? 
Times when it was pointless for me to try; 
I was more than a desperate man. 
What seemed like forever was gone with one touch of your hand. 
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights, 
when you were there for me. 
A fool could see, oh baby, 
once that I found you there was no letting go. 
Tell me: What kind of man would I be, 
living a life without any meaning? 
And I know you could surely survive without me, 
but if I had to live without you, 
tell me what kind of man would I be? 
[Repeat and fade]
