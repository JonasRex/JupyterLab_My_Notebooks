Here we are, face to face. We forget time and place. Hold me now, don't let go, though it hurts and we both know. The time we spent together's gonna fly and everything you do to me is gonna feel so right. Baby, when you're lovin' me, I feel like I could cry 'cause there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.

Here we are, all alone. Trembling hearts beating strong. Reaching out a breathless kiss I never thought could feel like this. I want to stop the time from passing by. I wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine. Baby, when you're close to me, I want you more each time and there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.

BRIDGE:
There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless in your arms. Baby, what you do I'm in love, this is it. There's no turning back this time. No no no.

Here we are, once again but this time we're only friends. Funny world, sometimes lies become the game when love's the prize. And though no one knows what's going on inside, all the love I feel for is something I should hide. When I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime that there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.
