She sits alone by a lamppost 
trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind 
She says Dad's the one I love the most 
but Stipe's not far behind 
She lets me in 
only tell me where's she's been 
when she's had too much to drink 
I say that I don't care I just run my hands 
through her dark hair and I pray to God 
you gotta help me fly away 
And just: 
Let her cry:if the tears fall down like rain 
Let her sing:if it eases all her pain 
Let her go:let her walk right out on me 
And if the sun comes up tomorrow 
Let her be:let her be. 
This morning I woke up alone 
found a note by the phone 
saying maybe I'll be back some day 
I wanted to look for you 
You walked in I didn't know just what to do 
so I sat back down had a beer and felt sorry for myself. 
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Last nite I tried to leave 
She cried so much I just 
could not believe 
she was the same girl I 
fell in love with long ago 
She went in the back to 
get high 
I sat down on my couch 
and cried 
yelling oh mama please 
help me 
won't you hold my hand. 
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
