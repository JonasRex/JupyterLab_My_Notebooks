I don't wanna see you ever sad 
And everything that I've got you can have 
When it's all too much 
You need some human touch 
To see that it's really not so bad
Did you call on every saint you know 
But still you feel like you're on your own 
Can you see through your tears 
I will always be here 
And you're not out there all alone 
Chorus 
Hold On,'till you feel a little stronger 
Hold On to me 
Hold On,everything's gonna be alright 
Just Hold On to me tonight 
Anything that hurts you,hurts me too 
I'm not gonna let your world turn blue 
Will you take my hand 
And feel how close I am 
There ain't nothin'I won't do for you
Chorus 
I know the world 
Can drive you to your knees 
But when you need to cry,baby 
Cry to me 
Chorus
