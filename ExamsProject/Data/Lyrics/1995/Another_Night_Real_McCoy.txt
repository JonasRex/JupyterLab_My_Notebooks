Chorus: 
Another night, another dream, but always you, 
it's like a vision of love that seems to be true, 
Another night another dream, but always you, 
in the night I dream of love so true. 

Just another night, another vision of love, 
you feel joy, you feel pain, cuz nothing will be the same. 
Just another night, is all that it takes,
to understand, the difference between lovers and fakes, 
so baby, I talk talk, I talk to you, 
in the night in your dream, of love so true. 
I talk talk, I talk to you, 
in the night in your dream, of love so true. 
In the night, in my dreams, 
I'm in love with you, cuz you talk to me like lovers do,
I feel joy I feel pain, cuz it's still the same,
when the night is gone I'll be alone.

Chorus 

Just another night, another dream, another vision,
of love, with me, 
I'm here to set you free I am your lover, your brother,
hey sister let me cover, your body with my love is with my lovin' just another,
vision of love, that seems to be true, all we do all the things that only lovers do,
vision of love, that seems to be true, all we do all the things that only lovers do.
In the night in my dreams I'm in love with you,
cuz you talk to me like lovers do, I feel joy I feel pain, 
cuz it's still the same, when the night is gone I'll be alone. 

Chorus 

I talk talk, I talk to you in the night,
in your dream, of love so true.
I talk talk, I talk to you, in the night, in your dream, of love so true.
In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you,
cuz you talk to me like lovers do, I feel joy I feel pain
cuz it's still the same, when the night is gone I'll be alone.
