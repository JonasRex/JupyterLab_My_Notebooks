You and me 
We come from different worlds 
You like to laugh at me 
When I look at other girls 
Sometimes you're crazy 
And you wonder why 
I'm such a baby 
Cause the Dolphins make me cry 
[Chorus:]
Well there's nothing I can do 
I only wanna be with you 
You can call me your fool 
Only wanna be with you 
Put on a little Dylan 
sitting on a fence 
I say that line is great 
You ask me what I meant by 
"Said I shot a man named Gray 
Took his wife to Italy 
She inherited a million bucks 
And when she died it came to me 
I can't help it if I'm lucky" 
Only wanna be with you 
Ain't Bobby so cool 
Only wanna be with you 
[Solo]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue 
Only wanna be with you 
You can call me your fool 
Only wanna be with you 
Sometimes I wonder 
If it will ever end 
You get so mad at me 
When I go out with my friends 
Sometimes you're crazy 
And you wonder why 
I'm such a baby yeah 
The Dolphins make me cry 
Well there's nothing I can do 
Only wanna be with you 
You can call me your fool 
Only wanna be with you 
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue 
Only wanna be with you
