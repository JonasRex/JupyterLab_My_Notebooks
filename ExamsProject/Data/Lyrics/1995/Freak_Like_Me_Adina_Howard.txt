Let me lay it on the line 
I got a little freakiness inside 
And you know that the man 
Has got to deal with it 
I don't care what they say 
I'm not about to pay nobody's way 
'Cause it's all about the dog in me 
Mm-hmm 

I want a freak in the morning 
A freak in the evening just like me 
I need a roughneck brother 
Who can satisfy me just for me 
If you are that kind of man 
'Cuz I'm that kind of girl 
I got a freaky secret everybody sings 
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing 

'Cause I will be a freak until the day 
Until the dawn and we can pump pump 
All through the night 'till the early morn 
Come along I'll take you around the 'hood 
On a gangsta lean 
'Cause we can pump pump any time of day 
It's all good for me 

Boy you're moving kind of slow 
You got to keep it up now there you go 
There's just one thing that a man must do 
Mm-hmm 

I'm packing all the flavor you need 
I got you shook up on your knees 
'Cause it's all about the dog in me 

I want
