Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down. Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down. Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

Blow horns, you sure sound pretty. The violins keep movin' to the nitty gritty. When you hear the scratch of the guitar scratchin', then you know that rhythm carries all the action. Whoa, yeah.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

Flute player, play your flute 'cause I know that you want to get your thing off. But you see I made up my mind about it. It's got to be the rhythm, no doubt about it, whoa oh.

When the guitar player starts playin' with the syncopated rhythm, with the scrath scratch scratch, makes me wanna move my body, yeah yeah yeah. And when the drummer starts beatin' that beat, he nails the beat with syncopated rhythm with a rat tat tat tat tat on the drums. Hey yeah.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

Love to hear it, love to hear it, love to hear it. Yeah.

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down. Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down. Turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

Ma ma ma. Ma ma ma. Ma ma ma ma ma. Yes, uh! Yes, uh! Ma ma ma. Ma ma ma. Ma ma ma ma ma. Yes, uh! Yes, uh!

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

CHORUS:
Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it. Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion. Love to hear it.

Love to hear it!
