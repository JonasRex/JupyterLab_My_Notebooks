Mine immaculate dream made breath and skin I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo happy birthday to you was created for ya
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I belive you're taking my heart too pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time might take a little crime to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone

Words playing me deja-vu like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chills is it something real or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces
Lost in a snow filled sky we'll make it alright to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
(Can't ever keep from falling apart) Who do you need who do you love
When you come undone (can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need who do you love (can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you love when you come undone (can't ever keep from falling apart)
