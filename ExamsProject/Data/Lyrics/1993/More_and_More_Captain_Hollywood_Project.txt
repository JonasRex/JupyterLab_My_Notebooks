Could it be the love the answer when I want to stay  Here with you, only with you  Could it be the love that I want to give that I thought was true  But I just can't feel  Only with you, only with you   You sure just chill  Search for the world I deal  But you are doing what is real  Just you're teaching to the heal  And you're teatching not the steel  But we need to keep working  Just up the dirting  Away from all the jerks  So none of them can hurt  Take a look at waht we're doing  Cause a perfect… flowing  Ah yeah  If we take a look at mankind  Everybody is doing crimes  You know that it's time   You see a hole up in the sky  And we are acting wild  So why don't to discover yo  And try to change the topic  … Make profit  So don't you even bother it  Love is all what we are needing  Our Earth is bleeding  Hollywood is pleading  To anyone that is believing  … keep  So none of us get hurting  It's time for us to get right  Forget the black and the white  Just keeping love in sight  Preaching every day and night   I just don't know  Why I wanna stay  Love the answer  I just don't know  Why I wanna stay  Here with you  Only, only with you
