I've heard people say that Too much of anything Is not good for you baby But... I don't know about that ...As many times as we've loved Shared love and made love It doesn't seem to me Like it's ever, ever enough It's just ... not enough, no, no  CHORUS: My darling, I , can't get enough of your love baby Boy I don't know I don't know why I can't get enough of your love baby  Oh some things I can't get used to No matter how I try, oh It seems the more you give the more I want And baby that's no lie, oh no  Tell me .. what can I say What am I gonna do How should I feel, when everything is you you you What kind of a love is this That you've given me Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet, sweet You're all I know and every time you're near I feel a change Something's moving I scream your name What you got me doing  (repeat chorus)If I could only make you see And make you understand Boy your love for me is all I need now and more than I can stand Oh well  How can I explain All the things I feel You've given me so much Boy you're so unreal, unreal, unreal Well I keep loving you More and more each time Boy what am I gonna do Cause you blown my mind, mind I got the same old feeling Every time you're near I feel a change Something's moving I scream your name What you got me doing  Baby, it didn't take all of my life to find you And it sure ain't gonna take the rest of my life To keep ya, yeah, keep ya, happy No darling darling darling darling  happy   oooh  Chorus
