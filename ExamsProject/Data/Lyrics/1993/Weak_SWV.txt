I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you do to me 
It's a feeling that I want to stay

Now my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the problem here is you

I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak

Time after time after time I tried to fight it
But your love is strong
It keeps me holdin' on
Resistance is down when you're around my ba-a-by
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

Now my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the problem here is you

I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins (I get so weak)
Ooh, it's something I can't explain (I get so weak)
Something 'bout the way you do 
The things you do...
Knocks me right (off my feet)
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak

I don't know what it is that you're done to me 
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you what you're doin 
It's a feeling that I want to stay                    

Now my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the problem here is you

I get so weak in the knees
I can hardly speak
I lose all control
It's something comes over me
In a daze, it is so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off my feet
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak

Time after time after time
I try to fight it
But your love is strong
It keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around
In no condition, i don't want to be alone

Now my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
