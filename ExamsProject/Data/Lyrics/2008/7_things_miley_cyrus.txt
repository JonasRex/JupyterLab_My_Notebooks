One, two, three, four 

Sha, sha 

I probably shouldn't say this 
But at times I get so scared 
When I think about the previous 
Relationship we shared 

It was awesome, but we lost it 
It's not possible for me not to care 
And now we're standing in the rain 
And nothing's ever gonna change until you hear 
My dear 

The seven things I hate about you 
The seven things I hate about you 
Oh, you 

1. You're vain 
2. Your games 
3. You're insecure 
4. You love me, you like her 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy 
6. Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts 
I wanna be 
With the one I know 
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do 
7. You make me love you 

It's awkward, it's silent 
As I wait for you to say 
What I need to hear now 
Your sincere apology 

When you mean it, I'll believe it 
If you text it 
I'll delete it 
Let's be clear 

Oh I'm not coming back 
You're taking, seven steps here 

The seven things I hate about you 
1. You're vain 
2. Your games 
3. You're insecure 
4. You love me, you like her 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy 
6. Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts 
I wanna be with the one I know 
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do 
7. You make me love you 

and compared to all the great things 
That would take too long to write 
I probably should mention 
The seven that I like 

The seven things I like about you 
1. Your hair 
2. Your eyes 
3. Your old Levi's 
4. When we kiss, I'm hypnotized 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy 
6. Your hand in mine when we're intertwined... everything's alright 
I wanna be with the one I know 
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do 
You make me love you 

Sha, sha 
You do oh 

Ooh
