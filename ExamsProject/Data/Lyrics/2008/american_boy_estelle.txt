[Kanye West:]
Just another one champion sound
Me and Estelle about to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now.
Just touched down in London town.
Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Chorus: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy.

He said Hey Sister.
It's really really nice to meet ya.
I just met this 5 foot 7 guys who's just my type.
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'm a like what's underneath it.
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits.
First let's see the west end.
I'll show you to my bridrens.
I'm like this American Boy. American Boy

[Chorus:]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy

Can we get away this weekend.
Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a Caf√π.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I neva been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.
Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneaker's looking Fresh to Def I'm lovin those Shell Toes.
Walkin that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm likin this American Boy. American Boy.

[Chorus:]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy

[Kanye West:]
Who killin em in the UK. Everybody gonna to say you K, reluctantly, because most of this press
don't f**k with me. Estelle once said to me, cool down down don't act a fool now now. I always
act a fool oww oww. Ain't nothing new now now. He crazy, I know what ya thinkin. White Pino I
know what you're drinkin. Rap singer. Chain Blinger. Holla at the next chick soon as you're
blinkin. What's you're persona. about this American Brama. Am I shallow cause all my clothes
designer. Dressed smart like a London Bloke. Before he speak his suit bespoke. And you thought
he was cute before. Look at this P Coat, Tell me he's broke. And I know you're not into all
that. I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit. But I still talk that CAAASH. Cause a lot wags
want to hear it. And I'm feelin like Mike at his Baddest. The Pips at they Gladys. And I know
they love it. so to hell with all that rubbish

[Estelle:]
Would you be my love, my love.
Could be mine would you be my love my love, could be mine
Could you be my love, my love.
Would you be my American Boy. American Boy

[Chorus:]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy
