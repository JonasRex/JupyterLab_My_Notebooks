[Intro:]
I can’t help but wait…
Oh I, can’t help but wait…
Check it out

[Verse 1:]
I see you, you wit him- he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by, while he lies- then turn right round and forget
I can’t take to see your face, with those tears run down your cheeks
But what can I do- I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I’m still a G

[Bridge:]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Hook:]
Girl I can’t help but wait
Til’ you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait
Til’ you see that wit me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait
Til’ you, see you, for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

[Verse 2:]
Listen, it ain’t fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be, getting all that someone’s got
You should be rockin the latest in purses, bracelets, and watches, your worth
Much more than a occasional I love you
I’m thinking of you

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Brakedown:]
Get it together- you can do better
Seein’s believing 
And I see what you need so
I’m gone play my position 
Let you catch what you’ve been missin
I’m callin out, girl cause I can’t help but wait

[Hook 2x]

[Outro:]
Oh- can’t help but wait, babe
No-no-no-no-no-no
I can’t help but wait
Oh-oh-oh- can’t help but wait
No, no, no
