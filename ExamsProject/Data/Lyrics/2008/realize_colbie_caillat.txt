[V1:] Take time to realize, 
That your warmth is. Crashing down on in.
Take time to realize,
That I am on your side
Didn't I, Didn't I tell you.

But I can't spell it out for you, 
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I cant spell it out for you

[C:] If you just realize what I just realized, 
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realized what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if 
We missed out on each other now.

[V2:] Take time to realize
Oh-oh I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you.
Take time to realize
This all can pass you by.. Didn't I tell you

But I can't spell it out for you,
No its never gonna be that simple
No I can't spell it out for you.

[C:] If you just realized what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other 
Then we'd never find another 
Just realized what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if 
We missed out on each other now.

[V3:] It's not always the same
No it's never the same 
If you don't feel it to.
If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way.
It could be the same for you.

[C:] If you just realized what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other 
Then we'd never find another 
Just realized what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder 
Just realized what I just realized

OoOoOOo

Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now
