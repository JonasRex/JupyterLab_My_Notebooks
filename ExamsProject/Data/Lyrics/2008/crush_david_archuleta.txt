I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
There’s a rush, what a rush
Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me
It’s just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think
When you’re all alone
All that we can be
Where this thing could go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch your breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way I do
Cause I’m trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When were hangin, spending time girl,
Are we just friends
Is there more, is there more
See it’s a chance we’ve gotta take
Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever

Do you ever think
When you’re all alone
All that we can be
Where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch your breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way I do
Cause I’m trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away

Why do I keep running from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think
When you’re all alone
All that we can be
Where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch your breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way I do
Cause I’m trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away
This crush ain’t going away
Going away
Going away
