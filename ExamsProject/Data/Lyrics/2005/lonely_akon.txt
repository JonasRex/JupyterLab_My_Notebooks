I woke up in the middle of the night and I noticed my girl wasn't by my side,
coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was feenin,
so I hadda take a little ride, back tracking ova these few years,
tryna figure out wat I do to make it go bad,
cuz ever since my girl left me, my whole life came crashin

Around and stayed by my side,
