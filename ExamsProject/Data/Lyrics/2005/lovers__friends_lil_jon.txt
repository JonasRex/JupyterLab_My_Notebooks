Be be ay be be ay
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
A time to go a time to live
A place to be a love to give
When travelling around the world
My army of lovers
Disneyworld to Yellowknife
America my way of life
Riding on a wave of love
My army of lovers
A cherry moon a night of fun
We dance into the rising sun
I lost my soul in Tokyo
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
St. Tropez to la Defense
A perfume latin lovers' scent
A pleasure sweet my body heat
My army of lovers
My gentlemen polite and proud
From london Town I wave goodbye
The scorpio is rising high
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Pour l'univers on quitte la terre
Hereux joyeux
L'amour de Dieux n'a pas de frontiþres
Pour l'armþe qui voyage sous la lumiþre
In crystal snow my palace guard
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
Come shoot me with your laserbeam
My army of lovers
Taj Mahal I've come to rest
A royal bed a lovers' nest
Classic art we here explore
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world be be ay be be ay
