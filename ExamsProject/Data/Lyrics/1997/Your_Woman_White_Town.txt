Just tell me what you've got to say to me,
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth,
It comes as no surprise at all you see,
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through!

Now I know your heart, i know your mind,
You don't even know you've been unkind,
So much for all your high bread boxes waste,
Just use me up and then you walk away.
Oh you can't play me that way!

Well I guess what you say is true -
I could never be the right kind of girl for you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!

When I saw my best friend yesterday,
She said she never liked you from the start,
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same,
But you always knew you held my heart!

You're such a charming, handsome man,
Now I think I finally understand!
Is it in your jeans? I don't know!
But I'll stay for hours -- that's for sure!
Why did you play me this way?

Well I guess what you say is true -
I could never be the right kind of girl for you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!

Well I guess what they say is true -
I could never spend my life with a man like you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
