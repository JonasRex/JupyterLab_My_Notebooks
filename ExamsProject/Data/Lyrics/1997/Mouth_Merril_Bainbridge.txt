I feel like I've been blown apart.
There are pieces here I don't know where they go 
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips 
I bet you feel a little crazy but for me 
We'll be famous on t.v. 
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would it be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to tast it 
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it 
I jump on you, you jump on me 
You push me aut and even though you know 
I love you I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth 
When I kiss your salty lips 
You will feel a little crazy 
But for me I'll be famous on t.v. 
Now, will it be my fault 
If I take your love and throw it wide? 
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart 
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole 
And I know where they go
