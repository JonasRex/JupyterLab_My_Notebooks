You're my love, you're my sweetest thing 
Don't shy away, don't shy away 
Every night makes me hate the days 
Can't get enough of your love 
Am I wrong, am I so unkind 
Show me the way, don't turn away 
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind 
Every moment I was thinking of you 

Chorus 
Ooh Aah, just a little bit 
Ooh Aah, a little bit more 
Ooh Aah, just a little bit 
You know what I'm looking for 
Ooh Aah, just a little bit 
Ooh Aah, a little bit more 
Ooh Aah, just a little bit 
I'll give you love you can't ignore 

Feeling good, let's go all the way 
It's got to be, set me free 
But tonight, let my body say 
Take it slow, don't let it go 
How can I prove my love to you 
Baby please, you're all I need 
Like a child, but it's more than a phase 
Could act the angel, but it wouldn't be true 

Repeat chorus 

What can you do for me? 
Oh, what can you do 
'Cause I feel so alive 
I feel your love inside 

Just a little bit, a little bit more 
Just a little bit, Just a little 

Just a little bit, a little bit more 
Just a little bit, whoo-o-whoo-o-whoo-oo 

Repeat chorus to end
