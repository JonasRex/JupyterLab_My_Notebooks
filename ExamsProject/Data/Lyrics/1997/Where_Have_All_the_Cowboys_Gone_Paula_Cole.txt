Oh you get me ready in your 56 chevy 
Why don't we go sit down in the shade 
Take shelter on my front porch 
The dandy lion sun scorching, 
Like a glass of cold lemonade 
I will do laundry if you pay all the bills 

CHORUS: 

Where is my John Wayne 
Where is my prairie song 
Where is my happy ending 
Where have all the cowboys gone 

Why don't you stay the evening 
Kick back and watch the TV 
And I'll fix a little something to eat 
Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor 
How do you take your coffee my sweet 
I will raise the children if you pay all the bills 

Chorus 

I am wearing my new dress tonight 
But you don't, but you don't even notice me 
Say our goodbyes 
Say our goodbyes 
Say our goodbyes 

We finally sell the chevy 
When we had another baby 
And you took the job in tennessee 
You made friends at the farm 
And you joined them at the bar 
Almost every single day of the week 

Chorus 

I will wash the dishes while you go have a beer 
Where is my Marlboro man 
Where is his shiny gun 
Where is my lonely ranger 
Where have all the cowboys gone 
Yippee aw, yippee yea (3 times)
