Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, take my heart
and make me happy

Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, feel my heart
and make me happy

Here we go gettin' smooth to the groove
Watching lovely ladies how I sooth as I move
That's what they say but I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move
As I get close you whisper coco
I hold you in my arms and you say Jamboo
Scream and shout turn and say columbo
Now I gotta go yo coco

Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, take my heart
and make me happy

Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, feel my heart
and make me happy

That's the way I treat dem girls kinda smooth see
Cos' there's one man and yo! that's me see
So let me show you round as you sip your tee gee
But no coco loco boom while I take a pee lee
When I hold my baby tighter she says I do it nicer
I like my chicken with rice and lemonada
And that's what you get when she shout out Jamboo
Now I gotta go so coco

Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, take my heart
and make me happy

Put me up, put me down
put my feet back on the ground
put me up, feel my heart
and make me happy
