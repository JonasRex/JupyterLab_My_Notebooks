(Verse 1)
Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
(Verse 2)
Those days of warm rain come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stilness, soft spoken words
(Say it, say it again)
(Chorus)
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
(Chorus)
You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
(Say it, say it again)
(Chorus 2x)
(Bridge)
Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always Everywhere and every(thing)
(Bridge 3x)
(Chorus to fade)
