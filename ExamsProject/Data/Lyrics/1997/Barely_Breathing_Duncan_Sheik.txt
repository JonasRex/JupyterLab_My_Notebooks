Barely Breathing 

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear 
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears 
You really had me going, wishing on a star 
But the black holes that surround you are heavies by far 
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn 
Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born 
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide 
You really can't be serious if you have to ask me why 
I say goodbye... 

'Cause I am barely breathing, And I can't find the air 
I don't know who I'm kidding, imaging you care 
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day 
But I don't suppose it's worth the price, worth the price 
The price that I would play 

Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? 
I used to be so certain, and I can't figure out 
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain 
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame 
Will it ever change? 

Chorus

I've come to find, I may never know 
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? 

I rise above, or sink below 
With every time, you come and go 
Please don't come and go 

Chorus
