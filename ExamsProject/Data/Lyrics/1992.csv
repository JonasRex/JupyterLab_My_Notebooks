Tears in Heaven,Eric Clapton,"Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven  I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven.  Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven  I'll find my way Through night and day, 'Cause I know I just can't stay Here in heaven.

Beyond the door, There's peace I'm sure, And I know there'll be no more Tears in heaven.  Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven  I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven."

Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me,George Michael,"I can't light no more of your darkness All my pictures seem to fade to black and white I'm growing tired and time stands still before me Frozen here on the ladder of my life  It's much to late to save myself from falling I took a chance and changed your way of life But you misread my meaning when I met you Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  chorus : Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  I can't find oh, the right romantic line But see me once and see the way I feel Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm But these cuts I have, oh they need love to help them heal  chorus (x 2)"

Smells Like Teen Spirit,Nirvana,"Load up on guns and bring your friends It's fun to lose and to pretend She's over bored and self assured Oh no, I know a dirty word Hello, hello, hello, how low I'm worse at what I do best And for this gift I feel blessed Our little group has always been And always will until the end Hello, hello, hello, how low And I forget just why I taste  Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile I found it hard, it was hard to find  Oh well, whatever, nevermind Hello, hello, hello, how low With the lights out it's less dangerous Here we are now, entertain us I feel stupid and contagious Here we are now, entertain us A mulatto An albino A mosquito My Libido Yay, a denial"
Humpin' Around,Bobby Brown,"A one in a million chance You know the moment that you crossed over the line A casual glance No one has to read between the lines In the south of France it was spring time Special feelings come alive There's romance in the air, so they say Love could be a small cafe away  Love is a piece of cake And making love is all there is to eat It's a heart out of a lamb When yoy start to feel forever in a kiss But you must remember there's no point of refuge You only have a part in a lover's play And you could be the one left in the dark If someone takes a shortcut to your heart  All too soon you're touching for the last time No one has to tell you how it is It's just a memory two people share File it under foreign affair"
Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover,Sophie B. Hawkins,"That old dog has chained you up alright  Give you everything you need  To live inside a twisted cage  Sleep beside an empty rage  I had a dream I was your hero   Damn I wish I was your lover  I'll rock you till the daylight comes  Make sure you are smiling and warm  I am everything  Tonight I'll be your mother I will  Do such things to ease your pain  Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed   Open up on the inside gonna fill you up gonna make you cry   This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue  Give you something sweet each time you  Come inside my jungle book  What is it just too good  Don't say you'll stay  'Cause then you go away   Damn I wish I was your lover  I'll rock you till the daylight comes  Make sure you are smiling and warm  I am everything  Tonight I'll be your mother I will  Do such things to ease your pain  Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed   Shucks, for me there is no other  You're the only shoe that fits  I can't imagine I'll grow out of it  Damn I wish I was your lover   If I was your girl believe me  I'd turn on the Rolling Stones  We could groove along and feel much better  I could do it forever and ever  Give me an hour to kiss you  Walk through heaven's door I'm sure  We don't need no doctor to feel much better  Let me in  Forever and ever and ever and ever   I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind  I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear  Walked for days with no one near  And I return as chained and bound to you   Damn I wish I was your lover  I'll rock you till the daylight comes  Make sure you are smiling and warm  I am everything  Tonight I'll be your mother I will  Do such things to ease your pain  Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed   Shucks, for me there is no other  You're the only shoe that fits  I can't imagine I'll grow out of it  Damn I wish I was your lover   Just open up I'm gonna come inside I wanna fill you up I wanna make you cry.....

It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,Boyz II Men,How do I say goodbye to what we had  The good times that made us laugh  Outweigh the bad.   I thought we'd get to see forever  But forever's gone away  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.   I don't know where this road  Is going to lead  All I know is where we've been  And what we've been through.   If we get to see tomorrow  I hope it's worth all the wait  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.   And I'll take with me the memories  To be my sunshine after the rain  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.   And I'll take with me the memories  To be my sunshine after the rain  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.

Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,"Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? Caught in a landslide No escape from reality Open your eyes Look up to the skies and see I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy come, easy go A little high, little low Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me  Mama, just killed a man Put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama, life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooo Didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  Too late, my time has come Sends shivers down my spine Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody - I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows) I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo Figaro - magnifico  But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Spare him his life from this monstrosity Easy come easy go - will you let me go Bismillah!

Tennessee,Arrested Development,"Lord I've really been real stressed Down and out, losin ground Although I am black and proud Problems got me pessimistic Brothers and sisters keep messin up Why does it have to be so damn tuff? I don't know where I can go To let these ghosts out of my skull My grandmas past, my brothers gone I never at once felt so alone I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel Not just my spare tire (home) But lord I ask you (home) To be my guiding force and truth (home) For some strange reason it had to be (home) He guided me to Tennessee (home)  (Chorus) Take me to another place Take me to another land Make me forget all that hurts me Let me understand your plan   Lord it's obvious we got a relationship Talkin to each other every night and day Although you're superior over me We talk to each other in a friendship way Then outta nowhere you tell me to break Outta the country and into more country Past Dyesburg into Ripley Where the ghost of childhood haunts me Walk the roads my forefathers walked Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from Ask those trees for all their wisdom They tell me my ears are so young (home) Go back to from whence you came (home) My family tree my family name (home) For some strange reason it had to be (home) He guided me to Tennessee (home)  Chorus  Now I see the importance of history Why people be in the mess that they be Many journeys to freedom made in vain By brothers on the corner playin ghetto games I ask you lord why you enlightened me Without the enlightment of all my folks He said cuz I set myself on a quest for truth And he was there to quench my thirst But I am still thirsty... The lord allowed me to drink some more He said what I am searchin for are The answers to all which are in front of me The ultimate truth started to get blurry For some strange reason it had to be It was all a dream about Tennessee  Chorus"
The Best Things in Life Are Free,Luther Vandross,
Make It Happen,Mariah Carey,Not more than three short years ago I was abandoned and alone Without a penny to my name So very young and so afraid No proper shoes upon my feet Sometimes I couldn't even eat I often cried myself to sleep But still I had to keep on going Never knowing if I could take it If I would make it through the night I held on to my faith I struggled and I prayed And now I've found my way  If you believe in yourself enough And know what you want You're gonna make it happen Make it happen And if you get down on your knees at night And pray to the Lord He's gonna make it happen Make it happen  I know life can be so tough And you feel like giving up But you must be strong Baby just hold on You'll never find the answers If you throw your life away I used to feel the way you do Still I had to keep on going Never knowing if I could take it If I would make it through the night I held on to my faith I struggled and I prayed And now I've finally found my way   I once was lost But now I'm found I got my feet On solid ground Thank you Lord If you believe Within your soul Just hold on tight And don't let go You can make it Make it happen 
The One,Elton John,I saw you dancing out the ocean Running fast along the sand A spirit born of earth and water Fire flying from your hands  In the instant that you love someone In the second that the hammer hits Reality runs up your spine And the pieces finally fit  And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Baby you're the one  There are caravans we follow Drunken nights in dark hotels When chances breathe between the silence Where sex and love no longer gel  For each man in his time is Cain Until he walks along the beach And sees his future in the water A long lost heart within his reach
Set Adrift on Memory Bliss,P.M. Dawn,"The camera pans the cocktail glass, behind a blind of plastic plants; I found the lady with the fat diamond ring. then you know I can't remember a damn thing. I think it's one of those de ja vu things, or a dream that's tryin' to tell me something. Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it. I don't know, I doubt it. Subterranean by design, I wonder what I would find if I met you, let my eyes caress you, until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who? Often wonder what makes her work. I guess I'll leave that question to the experts, assuming that there are some out there. they're probably alone, solitaire. I can remember when I caught up with a pastime intimate friend. She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely, but you probably don't think nothin' of me."" She was right, though, I can't lie. She's just one of those corners in my mind, and I just put her right back with the rest. That's the way it goes, I guess.  Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you  Careless whisper from a careless man, a neutron dance for a neutron fan; marionette strings are dangerous things, I thought of all the trouble they bring. An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy, rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh. Tell me that she's not dreaming. She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning. Reality used to be a friend of mine, 'cause complete control, I don't take too kind. Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on. Guess who's piece of the cake was Jacc Bond She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign. I told her whispers in my heart were fine. what did she think she could do? I feel for her, I really do. And I stared at the ring finger on her hand, I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan, but I had to put her right back with the rest. That's the way it goes, I guess.  Baby you send me... Set adrift on memory bliss of you"
Stay,Shakespears Sister,"If this world is wearing thin  And you're thinking of escape  I'll go anywhere with you  Just wrap me up in chains  But if you try to go alone  Don't think i'll understand   Stay with me stay with me  In the silence of your room  In the darkness of your dreams  You must only think of me  There can be no in between  When your pride is on the floor  I'll make you beg for more   Stay with me stay with me  You'd better hope and pray  That you make it safe  Back to your own world  You'd better hope and pray  That you wake one day  In your own world  'Cause when you sleep at night  They don't hear your cries  In your own world  Only time will tell if you can break the Sspell back in your own world   Stay with me stay with me Stay, stay with me  Stay..."

All I Want,Toad the Wet Sprocket,"nothing's so loud as hearing when we lie the truth is not kind and you've said neither am i         but the air outside so soft is saying everything         everything  all i want is to feel this way to be this close, to feel the same all i want is to feel this way the evening speaks, i feel it say...  nothing's so cold as closing the heart when all we need is to free the soul but we wouldn't be that brave i know         and the air outside so soft, confessing everything         everything  and it won't matter now whatever happens to me though the air speaks of all we'll never be it won't trouble me  and it feels so close let it take me in let it hold me so i can feel it say..."
When a Man Loves a Woman,Michael Bolton,"When a man loves a woman Can't keep his mind on nothin' else He'd trade the world For a good thing he's found If she is bad, he can't see it She can do no wrong Turn his back on his best friend If he puts her down  When a man loves a woman Spend his very last dime Trying to hold on to what he needs He'd give up all his comforts And sleep out in the rain If she said that's the way It ought to be  When a man loves a woman I give you everything I got (yeah) Trying to hold on To your precious love Baby please don't treat me bad  When a man loves a woman Deep down in his soul She can bring him such misery If she is playing him for a fool He's the last one to know Loving eyes can never see  Yes when a man loves a woman I know exactly how he feels 'Cause baby, baby, baby I am a man When a man loves a woman ¡¡"
I Can't Dance,Genesis,"Hot sun beating down burning my feet just walking around. Hot sun making me sweat 'Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet I can't dance, I can't talk. The only thing about me is the way I walk. I can't dance, I can't sing I'm just standing here selling everything. Blue jeans sitting ont he beach, her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach. She's got a body under that shirt, but all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt. Cos, I can't dance, I can't talk. The only thing about me is the way I walk. No, I can't dance, I can't sing I'm just standing here selling. And checking everything is in place, you never know who's looking on. Young punk spilling beer on my shoes, fat guy's talking to me trying to steal my blues. Thick smoke, see her smiling through. I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool. But I can't dance, I can't talk. The only thing about me is the way I walk. I can't dance, I can't sing I'm just standing here selling And checking everything is in place You never know who's looking on A perfect body with a perfect face"
Hazard,Richard Marx,"That boy's not right       Three years ago when I came to know Mary       First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies       And saw the man inside       We used to walk down by the river        She loved to watch the sun go down       We used to walk along the river       And dream our way out of this town        No one understood what I felt for Mary       No one cared until the night she went out walking alone       And never came home       Man with a badge came knocking next morning       Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly       Pointed right at me        I swear I left her by the river       I swear I left her safe and sound       I need to make it to the river       And leave this old Nebraska town        I think about my life gone by       How it's done me wrong       There's no escape for me this time       All of my rescues are gone, long gone        I swear I left her by the river       I swear I left her safe and sound       I need to make it to the river       And leave this old Nebraska town"

It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping I can't imagine living my life after you're gone Wondering why so many questions have no answers I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong Where is our yesterday You and I could use it right now But if this is goodbye Just take my heart when you go I don't have the need for it anymore I'll always love you, but you're hard to hold Just take my heart when you go Here we are about to take the final step now I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turing back Face to face it's been endless conversation But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk I'd give my everything If only I could turn you around But if this is goodbye Just take my heart when you go I don't have the need for it anymore I'll always love you but you're hard to hold Just take my heart when you go"
I Will Remember You,Amy Grant,I will be walking one day Down a street far away And see a face in the crowd and smile Knowing how you made me laugh Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past I will remember you.  Look in my eyes while you're near Tell me what's happening here See that I don't want to say good-bye Our love is frozen in time I'll be your champion and you'll be mine I will remember I will remember you.  Later on When this fire is an ember Later on When the night's not so tender Given time Though it's hard to remember darlin' I will be holding I'll still be holding to you I will remember you.  So many years come and gone And yet the memory is strong One word we never could learn Good-bye True love is frozen in time I'll be your champion and you'll be mine I will remember you So please remember I will remember you I will remember you I will remember you I will remember you.

I Can't Make You Love Me,Bonnie Raitt,"Turn down the lights, turn down the bed  Turn down these voices inside my head  Lay down with me, tell me no lies  Just hold me close, don't patronize - don't patronize me CHORUS: Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark, in these final hours I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power But you won't, no you won't 'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't I'll close my eyes, then I won't see The love you don't feel when you're holding me Morning will come and I'll do what's right Just give me till then to give up this fight And I will give up this fight CHORUS: Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark, in these final hours I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power But you won't, no you won't 'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't"
