1989,1,Look Away,Chicago,Rock,"When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found, 
I'm said "";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you.""; 
Found someone else, 
I guess I won't be coming 'round. 
I guess it's over, baby; 
it's really over, baby, whoa... 
And from what you said 
I know you've gotten over me; 
it'll never be the way it used to be. 
So if it's gotta be this way, 
don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay. 
But if you see me walking by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
When we both agreed as lovers, 
we were better off as friends, 
that's how it had to be, 
yeah, that's how it had to be. 
I tell you I'm fine 
but sometimes I just pretend; 
wish you were holding me, 
wish you were still holding me, whoa... 
I just never thought, 
that I would be replaced so soon; 
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. 
I know I wanted to be free; 
yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. 
But if you see me waling by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found. 
I said "";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you."";

1989,2,My Prerogative,Bobby Brown,New jack swing,"Well I got a funny feelin'
But I'm gonna stay cool
Something's tellin' me I'm gonna break all the rules,
Let me tell ya I'm not insecure,
But I got an empty felling that you've got the cure

You said it all, you've got to stay
Too proud to fall, no more to say

Well I'm feeling sober but I'm high on the throne,
Like a demon sick and sick and tired of being alone,
I've made a bed that is hard to lie in,
But if lovin' you is wrong,
I can't do nothing but sin


Let them hang me
They would if they knew
Even half the things I've been doing with you
Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor
Watch me swingin' and I still want you more

"
1989,3,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,Poison,Glam metal,"We both lie silently still 
in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Chorus:
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song 
playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and 
easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now 
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess
Chorus
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains
Solo
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
But now I hear you found somebody new
and that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess
"
1989,4,Straight Up,Paula Abdul,Dance-pop,"Lost in a dream 
Don't know which way to go 
If you are all that you seem 
Then baby I'm movin' way too slow 

I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
How about some information--please 

Straight up now tell me 
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh 
Or am I caught in a hit and run 

Straight up now tell me 
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh 
Are you just having fun 

Time's standing still 
Waiting for some small clue 
I keep getting chills 
When I think your love is true 

I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
How about some information--please 

Straight up now tell me 
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh 
Or am I caught in a hit and run 
Straight up now tell me 
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh 
Are you just having fun 

You are so hard to read 
You play hide and seek 
With your true intentions 
If you're only playing games 
I'll just have to say--bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye 

Do do you love me 
Do do you love me 
Do do you love me 
Do do you love me 

I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
Are you more than hot for me 
Or am I a page in your history-book 

I don't mean to make demands 
But the word and the deed go hand in hand 
How about some information--please

1989,5,Miss You Much,Janet Jackson,Dance-pop,"Shot like an arrow going through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong,
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone

I'm rushing home
Just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see
Your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes f-feel so g-g-g good
So I'll tell you baby

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone

I miss you much
I really really miss you much
I miss you much
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
I miss you

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone

1989,6,Cold Hearted,Paula Abdul,,"How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a 
Always always number number one without a doubt 
When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin' 
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock 
You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love 
And he's been only only playing undercover all the while

You're the one givin' up the love 
Anytime he needs it 
But you turn your back and then he's off and runnin' with the crowd

Anything to please him

He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 

It was only late last night 
He was out there sneakin' 
Then he called you up to check that you were waiting by the phone 
All the world's a candy store 
He's been trick or treatin' 
When it comes to true love girl with him there's no one home 

He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes

1989,7,Wind Beneath My Wings,Bette Midler,Soul,"Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
to never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.
You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory,
while you were the one with all the strain.
A beautiful face without a name for so long.
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.

Did you ever know that you're my hero,
and everything I would like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.

It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
but I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.
I would be nothing without you.

Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I wish I could be.
I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings.

Did I ever tell you you're my hero
You're everything, everything I wish I could be.
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,
for you are the wind beneath my wings,
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.

Oh, the wind beneath my wings.
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.

Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,
so high I almost touch the sky.
Thank you, thank you,
thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.

1989,11,Right Here Waiting,Richard Marx,Soft rock,"I hear your voice on the line
      But it doesn't stop the pain

      If I see you next to never
      How can we say forever

      Wherever you go
      Whatever you do
      I will be right here waiting for you
      Whatever it takes
      Or how my heart breaks
      I will be right here waiting for you

      I took for granted, all the times
      That I though would last somehow
      I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
      But I can't get near you now

      Oh, can't you see it baby
      You've got me goin' CrAzY

      Wherever you go
      Whatever you do
      I will be right here waiting for you
      Whatever it takes
      Or how my heart breaks
      I will be right here waiting for you

      I wonder how we can survive
      This romance
      But in the end if I'm with you
      I'll take the chance

      Oh, can't you see it baby
      You've got me goin' cRaZy

      Wherever you go

1989,12,Waiting For a Star to Fall,Boy Meets Girl,Pop,"Waiting For A Star To Fall
performed by: Boy Meets Girl
written by:   George Merril/Sharon Rubican
I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why
I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you

     Trying to catch your heart
     Is like trying to catch a star
     So many people love you baby
     That must be what you are

          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah

I've learned to feel what I cannot see
But with you I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in superstition
I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free

     Trying to catch your heart
     Is like trying to catch a star
     But I can't love you this much baby
     And love you from this far

          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah

          Waiting for a star to fall
          And carry your heart into my arms
          That's where you belong
          In my arms baby, yeah

1989,16,Girl I'm Gonna Miss You,Milli Vanilli,,"Hey, at least these lyrics are real!

I knew it from the start

You would break my heart

But still I had to play this painful part

You rapped me 'round your little bitty finger

With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while

You put your spell on me

Took my breath away

But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay

I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you

Nothing could make me change my point of view

Oh girl

I'm gonna miss you baby


Giving all the love I feel for you

Couldn't make you change your point of view

You're leavin'

Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time

I just don't know what I should do


It's a tragedy for me

To see the dream is over

And I never will forget the day we met

Girl I'm gonna miss you


Like a honey bee

You look the best of me

Now I can't erase those memories

Like a fairy tale

You are so unreal

You left a scar that's so hard to heal

When you had a taste of paradise

Back on earth can feel

As cold as ice

I'm gonna miss you

I miss you


Giving all the love I feel for you

Couldn't make you change your point of view

You're leavin'

Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time

I just don't know what I should do

1989,17,The Look,Roxette,Pop rock,"1-2-3-4
Walking like a man,
hitting like a hammer,
she's a juvenile scam.
Never was a quitter,
tasty like a raindrop,
she's got the look.
Heavenly bound
cause heaven's got a number
when she's spinning me around,
Kissing is a colour,
her loving is a wild dog,
she's got the look.

She's got the look.
She's got the look.
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
and I go: la la la la la
she's got the look.

Fire in the ice,
naked to the T-bone
is a lover's disguise.
Banging on the head drum,
shaking like a mad bull,
she's got the look.
Swaying to the band,
moving like a hammer,
she's a miracle man.
Loving is the ocean,
Kissing is the wet sand,
she's got the look.

And she goes:
na na na na na na na na.
"
1989,18,She Drives Me Crazy,Fine Young Cannibals,Dance-rock,"I can't stop the way I feel

Things you do don't seem real

Tell me what you got in mind

'Cause we're running outta time

Won't you ever set me free

This waiting 'round's killing me




She drives me crazy



I can't get any rest

People say I'm obsessed

Everything you say is lies

But to me that's no surprise

What I had for you was true

Things go wrong, they always do




She drives me crazy



I won't make it on my own

No one likes to be alone




She drives me crazy

"
1989,19,On Our Own,Bobby Brown,New jack swing,"The motel lights were blinkin'
On my chartreuse four door Lincoln
On the dock the fish were stinkin'
I simply didn't have a care

And the old men sit 'round the cracker barrels
The children hum their Christmas carols
The train tracks all run parallel
But they'll all meet up one day

On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday

We used to tell each other lies
With our orange plastic button eyes
In a former life on a motel chair
I was Charlie Parker's teddy bear

Yeah, me and Bird we'd stay up late
I used to watch him contemplate
While his horn would sit by the window and
Wait till it was time for him to blow it

On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday

The only song I ever knew
Was  Moonlight Bay on the Avenue
These are the tales from the Devil's chin
Charlie I could've been a contender

And the old men sit round the cracker barrels
The children hum their Christmas carols
The train tracks all run parallel
But they'll all meet up one day

On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday
Who forgot that it was Sunday.
"
1989,20,Two Hearts,Phil Collins,Pop,"Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

We're two hearts...
"
1989,22,Listen to Your Heart,Roxette,Alternative rock,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile.
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.
You've built a love but that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. 

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye. 

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
the feeling of belonging to your dreams. 

And there are voices
that want to be heard.
So much to mention
but you can't find the words.
The scent of magic,
the beauty that's been
when love was wilder than the wind.

1989,24,If You Don't Know Me by Now,Simply Red,R&b,"If you don't know me by now 
        You will never never never know me 

        All the things that we've been through 
        You should understand me like I understand you 
        Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong 
        I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home 
        Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night 
        Cos we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight 

        If you don't know me by now 
        You will never never never know me 

        We've all got our own funny moods 
        I've got mine, woman you've got yours too 
        Just trust in me like I trust in you 
        As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do 
        Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye 
        What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye, oh

1989,25,Like a Prayer,Madonna,Dance-pop,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Chorus:

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me


Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing


Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me. Just like a prayer, 
I'll take you there. It's like a dream to me. 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me. Just like a prayer, 
I'll take you there. It's like a dream to me. 

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there. Your voice can take me there like a prayer

1989,30,Forever Your Girl,Paula Abdul,Dance-pop,"Hey baby 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 
Baby forever...and ever and ever 

Baby pick your head up 
Come on and look me in the face 
Cuz I can tell that somethin' 
Is bringin' you down 

Is it the rumor 
That another boy 
Wants to take your place 

Have you been hearin' the stories 
They're goin' around 
Baby just remember I gave you my heart 
Ain't no one gonna tear us apart 

He could promise the moon 
And the stars above 
Even if he promised me the world 
Just remember I'm forever your girl 

He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 

Honey listen to me 
Your love is all I need 
You should know that I don't need nothin' 
That money can buy 

So if a boy were to come along 
And try to make me leave you 

There'd be no need to worry 
I'm tellin' you why 

Baby don't you know that I love you 
And I'd never put nobody above you 
He could promise the moon and the stars above 
Even if he promised me the world 

Just remember I'm forever your girl 
He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 

I'm forever your baby 
Just remember I'm forever your girl 
He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 

When the mountains crumble into the sea 
That's the day someone'll come 
Between you and me 
Baby just remember I gave you my heart 

Baby he could promise me diamonds 
Even if he promised me pearls 
Honey you know I ain't lyin' 

Listen as I tell it to the world 
You gotta remember baby remember 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl

Baby forever and ever and ever 
We'll be together 
I'm forever your girl 
Baby forever and ever and ever 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever... 
Hey baby he could promise the world 

Girl you know I love you 
And I always will 
If we live 'til forever 
I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you still 

I'm forever your girl
"
1989,31,The Living Years,Mike + The Mechanics,Soft rock,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't  get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
"
1989,32,Eternal Flame,The Bangles,Soft rock,"
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating 
Do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning an eternal flame I believe it's meant to be, darling 
I watch you when you are sleeping 
You belong with me 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Or is this burning an eternal flame 

Say my name, sun shines through the rain 
A whole life so lonely 
And then you come and ease the pain

1989,34,When I See You Smile,Bad English,Glam metal,"Sometimes I wonder
If I'd ever make it through
Through this world
without having in you
I just wouldn't have a clue 
Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me 
Sometimes I wanna give up
Wanna give in
 I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright 
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining
right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me 
Oh yeah 
Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey 
And when the rain is falling
I don't feel it
Cause you're here with me now
I wanna ask you baby
It's all I¹ll ever need
 All I'll ever need 
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light
Oh I see it shining
right through the rain
When I see you smile baby
Baby when I see you smile at me 
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
 I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you baby
And everything's alright
Hey everything's alright
It's alright 
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light

1989,35,If I Could Turn Back Time,Cher,Pop rock,"If I could turn back time 

If I could find a way I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay


I don't know why I did the things I did I don't know why I said the things I said 

Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside 

Words are like weapons they wound sometimes.


I didn't really mean to heart you I didn't wanna see you go I know I made you cry, but baby


If I could turn back time If I could find a way I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay 

If I could reach the stars I'd give them all to you 

Then you'd love me, love me like you used to do


If I could turn back time


My world was shattered I was torn apart 

Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart 

You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care 

But I lost everything darling then and there


Too strong to tell you I was sorry 

Too proud to tell you I was wrong I know that I was blind, and ooh...

1989,36,Buffalo Stance,Neneh Cherry,Hip hop,"Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home. They all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo, Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo, Huh, sukka?
Chorus 1:
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me
Chorus 2:
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Get funky. Yeah Timmy.
Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ.
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place.
Chorus 1
Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax.
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch.
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass...rock this place!
What is he like? What's he like anway?
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean?
Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep...deeper into your soul.

Red roses, temptation, 
You make the most of a ify situation. 
I'm weighing my decision 
who's to say if it's love,or if it isn't? 
Only time will tell 
Just how well I'll get to know you. 
Don't mean to lead you on, 
But I want to take it slowly, slowly. 

Don't rush me 
I've made that mistake before, ah. 
Don't rush me. 
This love could be so much more 
It's well worth the waiting for 
Desire can mean danger, 
I wanna lover, not another stranger 
I'm saving all my passion, 
Who's to say if its love, or just attraction? 
Only time will tell 
Just how well I'll get to know you. 
Don't mean to lead you on, But I want to take it slowly, slowly. 

And my resistance is weakening,weakening everytime we touch. 
Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of. 

Don't rush me. 
I've made that mistake before, oh yeah. 
Don't rush me. This love could be so much more, 
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah. 
My resistance is weakening 
every time we touch, 
cause baby you've got everything, 
everything That I've been dreaming of. 


Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before, 
oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more, 
It's well worth the waiting for.

We both got jobs caus there's bills to play 
We got something they can't take away

Close the door, leave the cold outside 
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side 
We got something that'll never die 
Our dreams, our pride 

And I'll never let go cause 
There's something I know deep inside 

You were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man

Even if we don't know where we stand 
Only God would know the reasons 
But I bet he must have had a plan 
Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man 

Light a candle, blow the world away 
Table for two on a TV tray 
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK 
Our time, our way 

So hold me close better hand on tight 
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride 
We're two kids hitching down the road of life 
Our world, our flight 

And I'll know that you'll be live 
In my heart till the day I die 

Cause you were born to be my baby 
And baby, I was made to be your man

1989,40,Good Thing,Fine Young Cannibals,Northern soul,"The one good thing in my life

Has gone away I don't know why

She's gone away I don't know where

Somewhere I can't follow her 


The one good thing didn't stay too long

My back was turned and she was gone 


Good thing where have you gone

Good thing you've been gone too long

Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo 


People say I should forget

There's plenty more don't get upset

People say she's doin' fine

Mutual friends I see sometime 


That's not what I want to hear

I want to hear she wants me near 


Good thing where have you gone

Good thing you've been gone too long

Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo 


Then one day she came back

I was so happy that I didn't ask

Morning came into my room

Caught me dreaming like a fool 


Good thing where have you gone

Good thing you've been gone too long

Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo

the lyrics

Verse One:

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin body
A chich walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food they're serving, you're stone-cold munchin
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Verse Two:

You're on a mission and your wishin
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin for love in all the wrongplaces
No fine girls just ugly faces
Some frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin, so you're goin
Could care less about the five you're blowin
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

Verse Three:

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin goodness sakin
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin real high rollin
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin to prove
So don't just stand there bust a move

Verse Four:

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin really firm cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin faces pumpin
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do just bust a move
"
1989,43,"Once Bitten, Twice Shy",Great White,Rock and roll,"Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock-n-roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock-n-roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home from messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock-n-roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
I didn't know you had a rock-n-roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now it's dark and you're gone
My my my, once bitten, twice shy

I think about you
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I cant get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
I often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Chorus

I practice my words
And I build up the nerve
But uh
Words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye
Time after time
Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Do you believe in love
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Chorus:

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down


Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own


Express yourself
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Intermediate:

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
Express himself
Hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down


So please


Express yourself
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, then make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not Express yourself.

1989,58,Sowing the Seeds of Love,Tears for Fears,Psychedelic pop,"High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracry 
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues
And anything is possible when you're Sowing the Seeds of Love
Anything is possible - Sowing the Seeds of Love
I spy tears in thier eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste !
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels 
So without love and a promise land
We're fools to the rules of a Goverment plan
Kick out the style ! Bring back the jam !
Anything...
Sowing the Seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me in love
Feel the pain
Talk about it
If you're a worried man - then shout about it
Open hearts - feel about it
Open minds - think about it
Everyone - read about it
Everyone - scream about it !
Everyone
Everyone - read about it, read about it
Read in the books in the crannies and the nooks there are books to read
Chorus !
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
Every minute of every hour - "" I Love a Sunflower ""
And I believe in lovepower, Love power, LOVEPOWER !!!
Sowing the Seeds
An end to need
And the Politics of Greed
With love

Cupid please take your aim at me

Chorus:

Cherish the thought
Cherish the joy
Cherish your strength
Perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love

Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view


Who You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

1989,61,18 and Life,Skid Row,Glam metal,"Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
He had no money, oooh no good at home.
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

18 and life You got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat, His veins burned gasoline.
It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.
They say he loved adventure, ""Ricky's the wild one.""
He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun.

You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend

1989,62,I Don't Want Your Love,Duran Duran,New wave,"I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care 'cause you've got something I can share

Hey, take a chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the
Light of your second sight because
When you understand me
You might feel good around me now.

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realise
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination


Your rhythym is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love

I like noise 'cause I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down. I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me,
You might feel good around me


Your rhythym is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love

1989,65,Funky Cold Medina,Tone Loc,,"I'm thinking 

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin'for some action 

But like Mick Jagger said, ""I can't get no satisfaction"" 

The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me 

My threds are fresh and I'm looking def Yo, what's up with L-O-C? 

The girls I saw jockin'at the other end of the bar 

Havin' drinks with some no-name chump when they know that I'm the star 

So I git up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina 

I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" 

He said, ""Funky Cold Medina"" 

Funky Cold Medina 

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks 

Put a little Medina in your glass and the girls will come real quick 

It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac 

A couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap 

So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg 

Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me 

And did the Wild Thing on my leg 

He used to scratch and bite me before he was much, much meaner 

But now all the poodles run to my house 

For the Funky cold Medina 

You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood 

Brekin'down my door, 

I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Stroh's 

They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal 

Went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena"" 

I thought she'd be good to go with alottle Funky cold Medina 

She said, ""I'd like a drink, "" 

I said ok, I'd go get it 

Then a couple of sips, 

She sold licked her lips 

And I knew that she was with it 

So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned 

But when she got undressed 

It was a big old mess 

Sheena was a man 

So I threw him out, I don't fool around with in Oscar Meyer weiner 

You must be sure 

That your girl is oure 

For the Funky Cold Medina 

You know, ain't no playin'with a man 

This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies, ya know? 

Break it down 

Back in the saddle, lookin'for a little affection 

I took a shot as a conteatant on the Love Connection 

The audience voted and you know they picked a winner 

I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner 

She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin'soon what I'll be gettin' 

Instead she started talkin'about plans for a weddin' 

Said wait, slow down, love, not so fast, says ""I'll be seein'ya"" 

That's why I found you don't play around 

With the Funky Cold Medina 

Ya know what I'm sayin', that Medina's a monster, y'all Funky Cold Medina

Is it love that's on my mind,or is it fantasy 
Heaven, 
Is in the palm of my hand, 
and it's waiting here for you, 
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy 

If I close my eyes forever 
Will it all remain unchanged 
If I close my eyes forever 
Will it all remain the same... 

Sometimes, it's hard to hold on 
So hard to hold on to my dreams 
It isn't always what is seems 
When you're face to face with me 
You're like a dagger 
And stick me in the heart 
And taste the blood from my blade 
And when we sleep, would you shelter me 
In your warm and darkened grave 


Will you ever take me 
No, I just can't take the pain 
But would you ever trust me 
No, I'll never feel the same... 
Ohh...
I know I've been so hard to you 
I know I've told you lies 
If I could have just one more wish 
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

Close your eyes 
You gotta close you eyes for me

And memories are forever

But what will I do now with all this time

Even though it's come to this 
I'll close my eyes and make a wish 
Hoping you remember

Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh and on the way it grows

Es que no puedo, no puedo
no puedo estar sin tu amor
es que no puedo, comprende
por favor

Estoy buscando la forma de
entender, y aun se me hace dificil
compreder

Porque si juraste que esto no pasaria
que por el resto de vida me amarias

Porque permitimos que esto tan
lejos se fuera, que se nos escapara de
las manos de esta manera

Quizas hayastomado una puena decision
pero no sabes cuanto me afecta el corazon

Crees que sea mejor separanos si ya no
nos queda nada para que continuamos

Para ti no sera igual, pero de mi parte
te amo tanto y no dejo de extranarte

de remordimiento, ver que todo acabo
destroza mis sentimientos

Yo te juro nunca quize verte llorar
que tengo que hacer para que me
puedas perdonar

Que tengo que hacer para que logres olvidar
para que borres el odio y me vuelvas a aceptar

Aqui me tienes mujer, rendido a tus pies
Queda de ti que empezemos otraves

Mi corazon esta vacio y solo tu lo llenaras
sinceramente, no soporto ya mas

Te siento todos los dias en el aire que respiro
te siento en las noches cuando estoy durmido

Y te siento conmigo en cada paso que hago
y me muero por tenerte de nuevo a mi lado

El destino me ha traicionado, que mala suerte
tanto tiempo juntos para ahora perderte

Es que no puedo, no puedo, no puedo estar
sin tu amor es que no puedo,
comprendelo por favor

Si yo pudiera entrar dentro de ti para mostrarte
todo lo que significas para mi

He compartido con otras personas pero no
Es igual me he dado cuenta que
solo a ti puedo amar

Se que nunca es tarde cuando la dicha es buena
te propeto que esta vez valdra la pena

si verdaderamente estas decidida
solo que la muerte nos separe algun dia

      I never thought that it could be
      The way it stands right now
      Emotions running high
      Every night I wish that I
      Could tell you how I feel 
      Those words are here in my heart
      Oh but there is just one missing part 

      How to put it together
      How to say it right
      And let you know that
      Every night 

      I'll be dreamin'
      Dreamin'
      Hoping baby you will be there
      I'll be dreamin'
      Dreamin'
      Hoping baby you will be there 

      Let me take time out
      To try and find out
      If this could be real
      Cause reality scares me
      I've been living a fantasy
      How should I feel 

      Those words are here in my heart

1989,90,It's No Crime,Babyface,New jack swing,"
I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around and
Brought about a change in me

I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were runnin' fast
I was runnin' slow
Everybody said that it would not work
Love came and set me free
You were standing there to rescue me
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

Why, it's no crime
If I'm guilty of love
Let me do my time
Why, it's no crime
Everybody needs love

You never thought love
Came so easily
No doubt about it
Never in your dreams, no way

You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good our love could be
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well


I've spent half a lifetime
Waiting for someone
You say I know it was you
They don't recommend it
I don't understand it
I've been reprimanded
'Cause I'm in love with you


You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good our love could be
Love caught it, we thought
Why can't we be in love, well

Why, why

So do I, so do I
So do I, so do I
Oh so do I


Why

Should I write or call your home
shout it out with a megaphone

got to find a way
to get my message to you
To say I love you with a neon sign
anything to make you mine

if I wait too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
that this time I know it's for real

1989,97,What You Don't Know,Exposé,Freestyle,"I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
My baby
I find out everybody know that
You've been using me
I'm surprised you
Let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart

There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be
Following you

Oh baby I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses
One by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from
Taking you

You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all

1990,1,Hold On,Wilson Phillips,Pop,"I know this pain 
Why do lock yourself up in these chains? 
No one can change your life except for you 
Don't ever let anyone step all over you 
Just open your heart and your mind 
Is it really fair to feel this way inside? 

Chorus:
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to 
Turn around and say goodbye 
Until then baby are you going to let them 
Hold you down and make you cry 
Don't you know? 
Don't you know things can change 
Things'll go your way 
If you hold on for one more day 
Can you hold on for one more day 
Things'll go your way 
Hold on for one more day 

You could sustain 
Or are you comfortable with the pain? 
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness 
You got yourself into your own mess 
Lettin' your worries pass you by 
Don't you think it's worth your time 
To change your mind? 


I know that there is pain 
But you hold on for one more day and 
Break free the chains 
Yeah I know that there is pain 
But you hold on for one more day and you 
Break free, break from the chains 

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to 
Turn around and say goodbye 
Until then baby are you going to let them 
Hold you down and make you cry 
Don't you know? 
Don't you know things can change 
Things'll go your way 
If you hold on for one more day yeah 
If you hold on 

Don't you know things can change 
Things'll go your way 
If you hold on for one more day, 
If you hold on 
Can you hold on 
Hold on baby 
Won't you tell me now 
Hold on for one more day 'Cause 
It's gonna go your way 

Don't you know things can change 
Things'll go your way 
If you hold on for one more day 
Can't you change it this time 

Make up your mind 
Hold on

1990,2,It Must Have Been Love,Roxette,Soft rock,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely,
there's air of silence in the bedroom
and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been love but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.

From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out.
Make-believing we're together that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winters day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It's all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows.

1990,3,Nothing Compares 2 U,Sinéad O'Connor,Pop,"It's been seven hours and fifteen days 
Since u took your love away 
I go out every night and sleep all day 
Since u took your love away 
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want 
I can see whomever I choose 
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant 
But nothing 
I said nothing can take away these blues 
`Cause nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u 
It's been so lonely without u here 
Like a bird without a song 
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling 
Tell me baby where did I go wrong 
I could put my arms around every boy I see 
But they'd only remind me of you 
I went to the doctor n'guess what he told me 
Guess what he told me 
He said girl u better have fun 
No matter what u do 
But he's a fool 
`Cause nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u 
All the flowers that u planted, mama 
In the back yard 
All died when u went away 
I know that living with u baby was sometimes hard 
But I'm willing to give it another try 
Nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u 
Nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u 
Nothing compares 
Nothing compares 2 u

Look around everywhere you turn is heartache
You try everything you can to escape

When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today

It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

Chorus:

Come on, vogue
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
You know you can do it

All you need is your own imagination
Go inside, for your finest inspiration

It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it


Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball
So get up on the dance floor

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be

It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
Can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice...

Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cos she didn't fit in there

With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night

Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool 
With my homegirl, Paula Abdul 

Baby seems we never ever agree 
You like the movies 
And I like T.V. 
I take things serious 
And you take 'em light 
I go to bed early 
And I party all night 

Our friends are sayin' 
We ain't gonna last 
Cuz I move slowly 
And baby I'm fast 

I like it quiet 
And I love to shout 
But when we get together 
It just all works out 

I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 

Who'd a thought we could be lovers 
She makes the bed 
And he steals the covers 

She likes it neat 
And he makes a mess 
I take it easy 
Baby I get obsessed 
She's got the money 
And he's always broke 
I don't like cigarettes 
And I like to smoke 

Things in common 
Just ain't a one 
But when we get together 
We have nothin' but fun 

I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 


Baby ain't it somethin' 
How we lasted this long 
You and me 
Provin' everyone wrong 
Don't think we'll ever 
Get our differences patched 

Don't really matter 
Cuz we're perfectly matched 



Nothing in common but this trust 
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus 
One going up, one coming down 
But we seem to land on common ground 

When things go wrong we make corrections 
To keep things moving in the right direction 
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack

Such a good time
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
"
1990,17,Close to You,Maxi Priest,Soul,"She was A Jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' mi lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' mi 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds mi back or she too far
Windin' mi up just to let her down
So emotional, gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the full moon rising, I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She got an attitude, I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard

Her blood was hot, she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you

Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' mi lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
And show you the way I feel

And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

1990,18,Black Velvet,Alannah Myles,Country rock,"Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell

Jimmy Rogers on the victrola up high

Mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder

The Sun is setting like molasses in the sky.

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything.

Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.


CHORUS:


Black velvet and that little boy smile

Black velvet with that slow southern style

A new religion that'll bring you to your knees

Black velvet if you please.


Up in Memphis the music's like a heat wave

White lightning, bound to drive you wild.

Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl

""Love me tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true.


Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.


CHORUS:


Black velvet and that little boy smile

Black velvet with that slow southern style

A new religion that'll bring you to your knees

Black velvet if you please.


Every word of every song that he sang was for you.

In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, 


What could you do?

CHORUS:


Black velvet and that little boy smile

Black velvet with that slow southern style

A new religion that'll bring you to your knees

Black velvet if you please.

Black velvet and that little boy smile

Black velvet with that slow southern style

A new religion that'll bring you to your knees

Black velvet if you please.


...If you please

If you please

1990,19,Release Me,Wilson Phillips,,"I know that it's time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will you still feel the same?

How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't want to give up
But baby it's time I had two feet on the ground
Can you release me
Can you release me
Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me

Chorus:
Come on baby, come on baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we want to be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby you've just got to release me
Release me
Release me
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find
What you're looking for


What is this power you've got on me
What is this power, Oh
What is it,What is it


Release me
Will you release me
Ah...Release me
Will you release me

They're just thorns without the rose 
Be careful of them in the dark 
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one 
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now 

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train

On a downtown train 

I know your window and I know its late 
I know your stairs and your doorway 
I walk down your street and past your gate 
I stand by the light of the four way 
and watch them as they fall, oh baby 
They all having their heart attacks 
They stay at the carnival 
But they'll never win you back 

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Every night, every night its just the same 
You leave me lonely 
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain 
On a downtown train 

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Every night, every night its just the same

Ice Ice Baby Ice Ice Baby 

All right stop Collaborate and listen 

Ice is back with my brand new invention 

Something grabs a hold of me tightly flow 

like a harpoon daily and nightly 

Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know 

Turn off the lights and I'll glow 

To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal 

Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle


Dance Bum rush the speaker that booms 

I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom

Deadly when I play a dope melody 

Anything less than the best is a felony 

Love it or leave it you better gain way 

You better hit bull's eye

The kid don't play 

If there was a problem Yo I'll solve it 

Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 


Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 


Now that the party is jumping 

With the bass kicked in the Vegas are pumpin'

Quick to the point to the point no faking 

I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon 

Burning them if you aint quick and nimble 

I go crazy when I hear a cymbal 

And a hi hat with a souped up tempo 

I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo 

Rollin' in my 5.0

With my ragtop down so my hair can blow 

The girlies on standby Waving just to say Hi

Did you stop? No -- I just drove by 

Kept on pursuing to the next stop 

I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block

That block was dead 


Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. 

Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis 

Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis 

Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine 

Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine 

Ready for the chumps on the wall 

The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls

Gunshots ranged out like a bell 

I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells

Falling on the concrete real fast 

Jumped in my car slammed on the gas 

Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed 

I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack

Police on the scene you know what I mean 

They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends

If there was a problem you I'll solve it 

Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 


Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 


Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 

Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it

My town that created all the bass sound 

Enough to shake kick holes in the ground 

'Cause my style's like a chemical spill 

Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel

Conducted and formed

This is a hell of a concept

We make it hype and you want to step with this

Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja 

Cut like a razor blade so fast Other DJs say ""damn""

If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose

Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 

If there was a problem Yo -- I'll solve it!

Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it


Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 


Yo man -- Let's get out of here!

Word to your mother!

1990,49,Come Back to Me,Janet Jackson,R&b,"Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago
All my life I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind I hated
Not able to let go

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long
My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me

Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are I love you
All my life I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind I hated
Not able to let go

1990,51,Praying for Time,George Michael,Pop,"These are the days of the open hand
They will not be tyhe last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Because God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say  quot;what's mine is mine and not yours quot;
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Because God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you

That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time

1990,52,How Can We Be Lovers,Michael Bolton,,"CHORUS:
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends
Baby, how can we make love if we can't make amends
Tell me how we can be lovers if we can't be,
can't be friends

Look at us now, look at us baby
Still tryin' to work it out
Never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy
Whoa, whoa, when there's no
communication
Whao, Whoa, it's a no win situation

CHORUS:

We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Whoa, Whoa, ain't it time we started tryin'
Whoa, whoa, gotta stop this love from dying

Baby, love is tough but we can take it
Baby, times are rough but we can make it
We can work it out

1990,53,Do You Remember?,Phil Collins,Soft rock,"We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cos I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
Yes we could try, like we tried before
When you kept on telling me those lies

Do you remember...

There seemed no way to make up
'Cos it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget

You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the difference between us
But it seemed too far for you to go.

Do you remember...

Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'cos they just can't wait
To get hurt again

Do you remember...

There are things we won't recall
Feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
Cos we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But ""I love you"" wasn't one of those things 
And now it's too late

Do you remember...

Dance to this an' you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

You said you didn't need me in your life
I guess you were right
Well I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
And I know it's eating me through every night and day

difference

I paint a picture of the days gone by
Then love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday
Walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe without a sound

I said I give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday
Walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We've had our share of  hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away

'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh my darling, I love you

Remember yesterday
Walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day

Baby, when you're lovin' me, I feel like I could cry 'cause there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.

Here we are, all alone. Trembling hearts beating strong. Reaching out a breathless kiss I never thought could feel like this. I want to stop the time from passing by. I wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine. Baby, when you're close to me, I want you more each time and there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.

BRIDGE:
There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless in your arms. Baby, what you do I'm in love, this is it. There's no turning back this time. No no no.

Here we are, once again but this time we're only friends. Funny world, sometimes lies become the game when love's the prize. And though no one knows what's going on inside, all the love I feel for is something I should hide. When I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime that there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you.

But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet
You want it all but you can't have it

So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me

Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight
CHORUS
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will
CHORUS
Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?
CHORUS
No I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

It keeps a happy home

And no one does it like me

Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me

When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

And no one does it like me

It's alright with me

It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me


Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me

1990,90,This One's for the Children,New Kids on the Block,Pop,"This is a very serious message so all of you please listen. 
There are some people living in this world 
They have no food to eat 
They have no place to go 
But we all are God's children 
We've got to learn to love one another 
Just remember, they could be us 
Remember, we all are brothers 

I'm not trying to darken up your day 
But help others in need 
And show them there's a better way 

This one's for the children 
The children of the world 
This one's for the children 
May God keep them in His throne 

Many people are happy 
And many people are sad 
Some people have many things 
That others can only wish they had 
So for the sake of the children 
Show them love's the only way to go 
'Cause they are tomorrow and people, they've got to know 

I'm not trying to darken up your day 
But help others in need 
And show them there's a better way 

This one's for the children 
The children of the world 
This one's for the children 
May God keep them in His throne

1990,91,What It Takes,Aerosmith,Glam metal,"There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring 
And, uh, all those late night promises I guess they don't mean a thing 
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man? 
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made? 
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away. 
I used to feel your fire 
But now it's cold inside 
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah 

Chorus: 
Tell me what it takes to let you go 
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go 
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night 
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice? 
Tell me what it takes to let you go. 

Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E. Fine 
but your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time 
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry 
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise 
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes 

Chorus 
Guitar! 

Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone 
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch 
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much 
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me 

Chorus 

Tell me what it takes to let you go 
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go 
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night 
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice? 
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice 
No no no no 'cause I don't wanna burn in paradise 
Ooo Let go, let go, let go,

1990,92,Forever,Kiss,Hard rock,"You set my soul at ease 
Chased darkness out of view 
Left your desperate spell on me 
Say you feel it to 
I know you do 
I've got so much more to give 
This can't die, I yearn to live 
Pour yourself all over me 
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees 

I wanna love you forever 
And this is all I'm asking of you 
10,000 lifetimes together 
Is that so much for you to do 
Cuz from the moment that I saw your face 
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace 
I swear I knew. 
I'm gonna love you forever 

My mind fails to understand 
What my heart tells me to do 
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you 
and that would do 
I've always been taught to win 
And I never thought I'd fall 
Be at the mercy of a man 
I've never been 
Now I only want to be right where you are. 


In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no 
Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday 
Cuz when I'm with you there's nowhere else 
That I would ever wanna be no 
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you 
Loving me ... I'm gonna love

1991,1,(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,Bryan Adams,Soft rock,"Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams

Bryan Adams:
I finally found someone 
That knocks me off my feet 
I finally found the one 
That makes me feel complete. 

Barbra Streisand:
It started over coffee 
We started out as friends 
It's funny how from simple things 
The best things begin. 

Bryan Adams:
This time it's different 
And it's all because of you 
It's better than it's ever been 
'Cause we can talk it through 

Barbra Streisand:
My favorite line was 
 quot;Can I call you sometimes quot; 
It's all you had to say 
To take my breath away. 

CHORUS Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams:
This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone. 

Bryan Adams:
Did I keep you waiting 

Barbra Streisand:
I didn't mind 

Bryan Adams:
I apologize. 

Barbra Streisand:
Baby, that's fine 

Bryan Adams:
I would wait forever just to know 
You were mine. 
You know, I love your hair 
Are you sure it looks right 
I love what you wear 
Isn't it too tight 
You're exceptional 
Can't wait for the rest of my life. 

CHORUS Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams:
This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone.

1991,3,Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),C+C Music Factory,,"Things that make you go hmm
I was at the crib, sittin' by the fireplace
Drinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug
The door bell rang.  Who could it be?
Thought to myself then started to shrug
Got to the door.  Ding Dong. Who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit.
Sly as can be, tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful.  I really didn't have the gall.
I tried to chilll.  She made the move.
Now I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve.
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girl didn't trust me.  No!
Yeah, but she lost control I wouln't take the bait.
I said chill baby baby chill baby baby wait
My girl bust in, Caught us creating a boom
She said ""Girlfriend""?
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm, hmm, hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Here's how it started
Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind
There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say hey
I watched the fight.  I thought is was alright.
'Cause me and Jay were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type.
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills
It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe
Before my eyes in the delivery room.
The things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
The things that make you go hmm, hmm, hmm
The things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
The things that make you go hmm.
Robbie Rob - break it down!
Give it to me Give it to me
Seventeen and I was havin' a ball
Eleventh grade and ""Joe"" I knew it all
I fell in love for the very first time
With this girl she really blew my mind
Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash
We said hello and my heart be stopped
She was the world and I was on top
Time went by, She filled my universe
We made love, She said I was the first
My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know
I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe
I'll ask my girl I know she only loves me
Wasn't I the one who tool your viginity?
The look on her face read sorrow and gloom
She said ""Yeah, Why do you guys always ask that?""
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Hey ladies
Have you ever had a man
Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk
Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to be treat
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts
Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself  ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me
I wonder who bought him those BVD's
Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas
Over the guys and I'm getting jealous

1991,6,Unbelievable,EMF,Alternative rock,"You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
But don't listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through
And leave you
The things, you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things, you say
You're unbelievable
You burden me with your problems
By telling me more than mine
I'm always so concerned
With the way you say
You've always go to stop
To think of us being one
Is more than I ever know
But this time, I realize
I'm going to shoot through
And leave you
Seemingly lastless, don't mean
You can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times
Pushing down the better few
Instead of bringing out the clues
To what the world and everything anger to
Brace yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems.
What the fuck was that
It's unbelievable

Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two

Just to let you know

Exactly the way I feel

To let you know my love’s for real


Because I love you

And I’ll do anything

I’ll give you my heart, my everything

Because I love you

I’ll be right by your side

To be your light, to be your guide


If you should feel

That I don’t really care

And that you’re starting to lose ground

Just let me reassure you

Tah tyou can count on me

And that I’ll always be around


Because I love you

My heart’s an open door

Girl, won’t you please come on in

Because I love you

I’ll be right by your side

To be your light, to be your guide

Because I love you

I’ll be right by your side

To be your light, to be your guide

1991,13,Someday,Mariah Carey,Dance-pop,"You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but didn't know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday oo someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others


Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time
When you're cold and lonely
Baby how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when you're down
In your time of need
And you're thinking
That you might be coming back to own me
Just think again
'Cause I won't need your love anymore

1991,15,From a Distance,Bette Midler,Country,"From a distance the world looks blue and green,
and the snow-capped mountains white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
and the eagle takes to flight.

From a distance, there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
it's the voice of every man.

From a distance we all have enough,
and no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
no hungry mouths to feed.

From a distance we are instruments
marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.
God is watching us. God is watching us.
God is watching us from a distance.

From a distance you look like my friend,
even though we are at war.
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
what all this fighting is for.

From a distance there is harmony,
and it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
it's the heart of every man.

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves.
This is the song of every man.
And God is watching us, God is watching us,
God is watching us from a distance.
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching.
God is watching us from a distance.

1991,16,All the Man That I Need,Whitney Houston,,"I used to cry myself to sleep at night 
But that was all before he came 
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right 
But now he's here 
It's not the same, it's not the same 

He fills me up 
He gives me love 
More love than I've ever seen 
He's all I've got, 
He's all I've got in this world 
But he's all the man that I need 

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes 
He takes me down and rocks me slow 
And in the evening when the moon is high 
He holds me close and won't let go 
He won't let go

1991,19,Love Will Never Do (Without You),Janet Jackson,Dance-pop,"Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Like you do do do do babe

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

1991,21,Justify My Love,Madonna,House,"I wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what

Chorus:

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love

Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

I want to know you
Not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either
I just wanna be your lover
I wanna be your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me


Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do
What are you gonna do
Talk to me -- tell me your dreams
Am I in them
Tell me your fears
Are you scared
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!

Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I wanna be your baby


I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting, to justify
Waiting, to justify my love
Praying, to justify
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my love

1991,22,Emotions,Mariah Carey,R&b,"You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside


In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside


You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

1991,23,Joyride,Roxette,Pop rock,"I hit the road out of nowhere 
I had to jump in my car 
And be a rider in a love game 
Following the stars 
Don't need no book of wisdom 
I get no money talk at all 

She has a train going downtown 
She's got a club on the moon 
And she's telling all her secrets 
In a wonderful balloon 

She's the heart of the funfair 
She's got me whistling her private tune 

And it all begins where it ends 
And she's all mine, my magic friend 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride 

She's a flower, I can paint her 
She's a child of the sun 
We're a part of this together 
Could never turn around and run 
Don't need no fortune teller 
To know where my lucky love belongs, 
Oh no 

Cause it all begins again when it ends 
And we're all magic friends 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride 

Be a joyrider 

I take you on a skyride 
A feeling like you're spellbound 
The sunshine is a lady 
Who ROX you like a baby 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride

1991,26,I Don't Wanna Cry,Mariah Carey,Pop,"Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby
I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around


All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

"

Classic case of boy meets girl
Moving in the same direction

For passing the test of time

Every hour, every day.

It's bigger than you 
And you are not me 
The lengths that I will go to 
The distance in your eyes 
Oh no I've said too much 
I set it up 

That's me in the corner 
That's me in the spotlight 
Losing my religion 
Trying to keep up with you 
And I don't know if I can do it 
Oh no I've said too much 
I haven't said enough 
I thought that I heard you laughing 
I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try 

Every whisper 
Of every waking hour I'm 
Choosing my confessions 
Trying to keep an eye on you 
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool 
Oh no I've said too much 
I set it up 

Consider this 
The hint of the century 
Consider this 
The slip that brought me 
To my knees failed 
What if all these fantasies 
Come flailing around 
Now I've said too much 
I thought that I heard you laughing 
I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try 

But that was just a dream 
That was just a dream

1991,34,Coming Out of the Dark,Gloria Estefan,Pop,"Why be afraid if I'm not alone
Though life is never easy the rest in unkown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
It's shinning on me
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can
It may not make it easier but I have felt you
Near all the way


Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Forever I'll stand on the rock
Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

1991,37,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,Celine Dion,Pop,"So much to believe in - We were lost in time 
Everything I needed 
I feel in your eyes 
Always tought of keepin- 
Your heart next to mine 
But now that seems so far away 
Don't know how love could leave 
Without a trace 
Where do silent hearts go? 

Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 

Candle in the water - Drifting helplessly 
Hiding from the thunder- 
Come and rescue me 
Driven by hunger - 
Of the endless dream 

I'm searching for the hand that I can hold 
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know 
Where do silent hearts go? 

Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 
Where do all the lonely hearts go 

Then one touch overcomes the silence 
Love still survives 
Two hearts needing one another 
Give me wings to fly 

Where does my heart beat now 
Where is the sound 
That only echoes through the night 
Where does my heart beat now 
I can't live without 
Without feeling it inside 

I've got someone to give my heart to 
Feel it getting stronger and stronger 
And stronger 
And I feel inside 

Hearts are made to last 
Till the end of time

1991,38,Summertime,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,Hip hop,"Intro/Chorus: *sung*
summer, summer, summertime
time to sit back and unwind
Verse One: Fresh Prince
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
just a bit of a break from the norm
just a little somethin' to break the monotony
of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
a little bit out of control it's cool to dance
but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
give me a soft subtle mix
and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
and think of the summers of the past
adjust the base and let the alpine blast
pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime
Chorus
Verse Two: Fresh Prince
school is out and it's a sort of a buzz
a back then I didn't really know what it was
but now I see what have of this
the way that people respond to summer madness
the weather is hot and girls are dressing less
and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
riding around in your jeep or your benzos
or in your Nissan stting on lorenzos
back in Philly we be ou in the park
a place called the plateau is where everybody goes
guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
she turn around to see what you beeping at
it's like the summers a natural afradesiac
and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time
Chorus
Verse Three: Fresh Prince
it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
hustle to the mall to get me a short set
yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
the temperature's about 88
hop in the water plug just for old times sake
break to ya crib change your clothes once more
cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
about the days growing up and the first person you kiss
and as I think back makes me wonder how 
the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
all the kids playing out front
little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch
while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
then six o'clock rolls around
you just finished wiping your car down
it's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout
it looks like a car show
everybody come lookin real fine
fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
every moment frontin and maxin
chillin in the car they spent all day waxin
leanin to the side but you can't spead through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
there's an air of love and of happiness
and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness
Chorus

1991,39,Wind of Change,Scorpions,Rock,"Lyrics:Klaus Meine

I folow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

1991,44,Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave),Roxette,Pop rock,"In a time where the sun descends alone 
I ran a long long way from home 
To find a heart that's made of stone 

I will try, I just need a little time 
To get your face right out of my mind 
To see the world through different eyes 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower 

Tell me why 
When I scream there's no reply 
When I reach out there's nothing to find 
When I sleep I break down and cry 
Cry, yeah 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower 

Fading like a rose 
Fading like a rose 
Beaten by the storm 
Talking to myself 
Getting washed by the rain 
It's such a cold cold town 
Oh, it's a such cold town 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

Rivers flow into the sea

If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit
Where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do

Hole hearted
Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay kept warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit
Where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you

But now you're running away with my heart

Chorus:
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart, it's beating 'Don't say no'
My head keeps saying 'Take it slow'


You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous, woh
Ooh this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless... Impulsive

I never imagined you could
Blow my theory apart
But now you're running away... with my heart... my heart


You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Wanna be impulsive... reckless
And lose myself in your kiss... woh

Impulsive
I wanna be... impulsive
I'm gonna be impulsive... reckless
And lose myself, lose myself

1991,49,Love Is a Wonderful Thing,Michael Bolton,,"Birds fly, they don't think twice 
They simply spread their wings 
The sun shines, it don't ask why 
Or what the whole thing means 

The same applies to you and I 
We never question that 
So good, it's just understood 
Ain't no conjecture 
Just a matter of fact 

CHORUS
Love is a wonderful thing 
Make ya smile through the pouring rain 
Love is a wonderful thing 
I'll say it again and again 
Turn your world into one sweet dream 
Take your heart and make it sing 
Love, love is a wonderful thing 

The only thing a river knows 
Is runnin' to the sea 
And every spring when a flower grows 
It happens naturally 

The same magic when you're in my arms 
No logic can define 
Don't know why, just feels so right 
I only know it happens every time 

CHORUS

Oh when the cold wind blows 
I know you're gonna be there to warm me 
That's what keeps me goin' 
And our sweet love will keep on growin' 

CHORUS

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing 
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing 
It's what makes honey taste sweet 
It's what makes your life complete

1991,50,Rhythm of My Heart,Rod Stewart,,"Across the street the river runs 
Down in the gutter life is slipping away 
Let me still exist in another place 
Running under cover of a helicopter blade 

The flames are getting higher in effigy 
Burning down the bridges of my memory 
Love may still be alive somewhere someway 
where they're downing only deer 
a hundred steel towns away 

Oh rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum 
with the words 'I love you' rolling off my tongue 
No never will I roam for I know my place is home 
where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing 

Photographs and kerosene light up my darkness 
light it up, light it up 
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans 
Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you baby 
Oh baby 

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum 
with the words 'I love you' rolling off my tongue 
No never will I roam for I know my place is home 
where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing 
I'll be sailing 

Oh I've got lightning in my veins 
shifting like the handle of a slot machine 
Love may still exist in another place 
I'm just yanking back the handle 
no expression on my face 

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum 
with the words 'I love you' rolling off my tongue 
Never will I roam for I know my place is home 
where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing 

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum 
with the words 'I love you' rolling off my tongue 
No never will I roam for I know my place is home 
where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing 

The rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum

Never will I roam for I know my place is home

Got to the door.  Ding Dong. Who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit.
Sly as can be, tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful.  I really didn't have the gall.
I tried to chilll.  She made the move.
Now I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve.
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girl didn't trust me.  No!
Yeah, but she lost control I wouln't take the bait.
I said chill baby baby chill baby baby wait

Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind
There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say hey
I watched the fight.  I thought is was alright.
'Cause me and Jay were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type.
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills
It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe
Before my eyes in the delivery room.

With this girl she really blew my mind
Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash
We said hello and my heart be stopped
She was the world and I was on top
Time went by, She filled my universe
We made love, She said I was the first
My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know
I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe

Have you ever had a man
Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk
Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to be treat
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts
Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself  ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""

I hear them whisper, you won't believe it

We stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long

Thinking 'bout you every day
Dreaming 'bout you every night
Hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, Darlin'

Come on and take my hand and I¡¯ll pull you through 
But things will never change until you want them to

Shake off those sad blues 
Get yourself a new view

But baby that old luck's gonna change

1991,64,Around the Way Girl,LL Cool J,Golden age hip hop,"
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings
At least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion
Using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl

Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in them
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap but petty 
You're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around the way girl

Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your home girls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for whining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee I love you
You're from around the way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
I need an around the way girl
An around the way girl
Fine as can be
She oh yea
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
The only one for me
I need an around the way girl
An around the way girl
Fine as can be

1991,68,Show Me the Way,Styx,Soft rock,"Every night I say a prayer in the hope that there's a heaven
And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way

And as I slowly drift to sleep, for a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid that I just won't know

Show me the way, Show me the way
Take me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away

And if I see a light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
Show me the way

Every night I say a prayer
In the hope that there's a heaven...

1991,69,Love Takes Time,Mariah Carey,Pop,"I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly


You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do
Inside

1991,70,Cry for Help,Rick Astley,,"She's taken my time. 
Convince me she's fine. 
But when she leaves I'm not so sure. 
It's always the same. 
She's playing her game. 
And when she goes I feel to blame. 
Why won't she say she needs me? 
I know she's not as strong as she seems. 

Why don't I see her cry for help? 
Why don't I feel her cry for help? 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 

I wandered around 
the streets of this town 
trying to find sense of it all. 
The rain on my face, 
it covers the trace 
of all the tears I'd had to waste. 
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why must we never break down and cry? 

All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 

No need to feel ashamed. Release the pain. Cry for help. 

Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 
Cry for help is all I need. 
All I need is a cry for help. 

Why must we hide emotions? 
Why can't we ever break down and cry? 
All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 

All that I need is to cry for help. 
Somebody please hear me cry for help. 
All I can do is cry for help. 

All that I need is to cry for help. 
I will be there when you cry for help. 
Is it so hard to cry for help?

1991,74,Too Many Walls,Cathy Dennis,Pop,"Many men have loved the bells
you fastened to the rein,
and everyone who wanted you
they found what they will always want again.
Your beauty lost to you yourself
just as it was lost to them.
Oh take this longing from my tongue,
whatever useless things these hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one you love.

Your body like a searchlight
my poverty revealed,
I would like to try your charity
until you cry, 'Now you must try my greed.'
And everything depends upon
how near you sleep to me

Just take this longing from my tongue
all the lonely things my hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one your love.

Hungry as an archway
through which the troops have passed,
I stand in ruins behind you,
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.
I love to see you naked over there
especially from the back.

Oh take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
untie for me your hired blue gown,
like you would do for one that you love.

You're faithful to the better man,
I'm afraid that he left.
So let me judge your love affair
in this very room where I have sentenced
mine to death.
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
that he's shaken from his head.

Just take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
let me see your beauty broken down,
like you would do for one you love.

Like you would do for one you love.

1991,77,Place in this World,Michael W. Smith,Contemporary christian music,"Words: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick
Music: Michael W. Smith
The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming 
Is harder than it seems
Feels like I'm
Chorus:
Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world
If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me
Hear me asking
Where do I belong
Is there a vision
That I can call my own
Show me I'm
Chorus
"
1991,78,Something to Believe In,Poison,Glam metal,"Will I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised land
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hand
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried "";Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did"";
Chorus:
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty 
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again
Chorus
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home
Solo
I drive by the homeless sleeping on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read JESUS SAVES
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win
Chorus
You take the high road
And I'll take the low road
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
And give me something to believe in

1991,79,Wicked Game,Chris Isaak,Country,"The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.

It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.

I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.

And I never dreamed that I knew somebody like you.






What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.

What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.

What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.

What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and,




With you.


The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.

It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.

I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you.

And I never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you no,









Nobody loves no one.
"
1991,80,Get Here,Oleta Adams,Pop,"You can reach me by railway, you can reach me by trailway
You can reach me by airplane, you can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

You can reach me by sailboat, climb a tree and swing rope to
rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt, cross the border in a blaze of
hope
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer


You can windsurf into my life, take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon, but you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

I don't care, I dont care, I need you right here right now

yeah, yeah)

I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can
"
1991,82,Silent Lucidity,Queensrÿche,Progressive rock,"Chris DeGarmo

Hush now, don't you cry. 
Wipe away the teadrop from your eye. 
You're lying safe in bed. 
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head. 
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain of someone close to you leaving the game of life. 
So here it is, another chance. 
Wide awake you face the day. 
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide. 
A doorway that I run through in the night. 
Relax child, you were there but only didn't realize it and you were scared. 
It's a place where you will learn to face your fears, 
retrace the years and ride the whims of your mind. 
Commanding in another world. 
Suddenly, you hear and see this magic new dimension.
* I - will be watching over you
I - am gonna help you see it through. 
I - will protect you in the night. 
I - am smiling next to you...
... In Silent Lucidity
If you open your mind for me you won't rely on open eyes to see. 
The walls you built within come tumbling down, 
and a new world will begin. 
Living twice at once you learn you're safe from pain in the dream domain. 
A soul set free to fly, a round trip journey in your head. 
Master of illusion, 
can you realize your dream's alive, 
you can be the guide but...

1991,85,Real Real Real,Jesus Jones,,"i think i know what you mean

1991,86,Everybody Plays the Fool,Aaron Neville,Soul,"Ok, so your heart is broken 
You're sitting around mopin', mopin', mopin', cryin', cryin' 
You say you're even thinking about dying 
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, listen to this 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do 
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you 
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be 
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds you're mind with emotion 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

How can you help it, when the music starts to play 
And your ability to reason, is swept away 
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality 
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you 

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime 
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby 
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again, 
Everybody plays the fool 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

Every plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again 
Everybody plays the fool

1991,90,Disappear,INXS,,"Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on T.V
Pain and suffering
And the struggle to be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say your mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Say if I could
Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings

Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realise all that I am
You put the light inside this man

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

1991,91,Groove Is in the Heart,Deee-Lite,Disco,"We're going to dance,

And have some fun

The chills that you
Spill up my back
Keep me filled with
Satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come

1991,92,All This Time,Sting,,"I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
I saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
I saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

And all this time, the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which was the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows

And all this time, the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man,
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of a needle
And as these words were spoken I swore I hear
The old man laughing
'What good is a used up world and how could it be
Worth having'

And all this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
And all this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists,
Then how come he never lived here

The teachers told us, the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple, an edge of the empire
Garrison town,
They lived and they died, they prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled, 'til all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

And all this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
But they only get better
One by one
One by one...
"
1991,93,The One and Only,Chesney Hawkes,Pop rock,"I am the one and only, 

Oh yeah! 

Call me, call me by my name or call me by number, 

Just put me through, 

I'll still be doing it the way I do it, 

And yet, you try to make me forget, 

Who I really am, don't tell me, I'd know best, 

I'm not the same as all the rest, 


Chorus: 

I am the one and only, 

Nobody I'd rather be, 

I am the one and only, 

You can't take that away from me 


I've been a player in the crowd scene, 

A flicker on the big screen, 

My soul embraces one more in a million faces, 

High hopes and aspirations, ideas above my station 

Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride 




I can't wear this uniform without some compromises, 

Because you'll find out that we come, 

In different shapes and sizes, 

No one can be myself like I can, 

For this job I'm the best man, 

And while this may be true, you are the one and only you!

1991,94,O.P.P.,Naughty by Nature,Golden age hip hop,"Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em    
OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P...well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
Chorus:
As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it...ah...sorta properly
I say the last P...hmmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me  
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount
Chorus:
This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's  
that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, "";Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave"";
She said, "";Oh no, I love you Treach""; I said, "";Now child please"";
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it
Chorus:
Break it down!
"
1991,95,Freedom! '90,George Michael,Pop,"I won't let you down
I will not give you up
gotta have some faith in the sound
it's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
so please don't give me up
because I would really, really love to stick around

heaven knows I was just a young boy
didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirls pride and joy
and I guess it was enough for me
to win the race? a prettier face!
brand new clothes and a big fat place
on your rock and roll TV
but today the way I play the game is not the same
no way
think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
there's something deep inside of me
there's someone else I've got to be
take back your picture in a frame
take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
sometimes the clothes do not make the man

chorus
all we have to do now
is take these lies and make them true somehow
all we have to see 
is that I don't belong to you 
and you don't belong to me
freedom
you've gotta give for what you take
freedom
you've gotta give for what you take

heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
what a kick just a buddy and me
we had every big-shot goodtime band on the run boy
we were living in a fantasy
we won the race
got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
for the boys on MTV
but today the way I play the game has got to change 
oh yeah
now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's somethig youshould know
I think it's time I stopped the show
there's something deep inside of me
there's someone I forgot to be
take back your picture in a frame
take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
sometimes the clothes do not make the man

chorus

well it looks like the road to heaven
but it feels like the road to hell
when I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
posing for another picture
everybody's got to sell
but when you shake your ass
they notice fast
and some mistakes were build to last

that's what you get

I say that's what you get

that's what you get for changing your mind

and after all this time
I just hope you understand
sometimes the clothes do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
may not be what you want from me
just the way it's got to be
lose the face now
I've got to live

"
1991,96,I Saw Red,Warrant,Glam metal,"Ooh it must be magic
How inside your eyes I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me

If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled on to the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key

And if the sun
Should ever fail to send its light
We will burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled on to the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

I've been hurt and I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way

Cause I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled on to the floor
Mmm-mmm-mmm, I didn't need to see his face
Oh, I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Ooh it must be magic
"
1991,97,Miles Away,Winger,Glam metal,"So this is love, or so you tell me, as you're walkin' out the door
The months go by, and I know for certain, it's not the love I'm lookin' for

But sometimes just for a moment, I reach out, hope you're still there

Chorus:
Miles away, no you're never turnin' back and I just can't wait anymore
Miles away, nothing left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, you were miles away

It's hard to tell what you're going through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart and chances are, what you're feeling, I'm feeling too

If only just for a moment, hold on to the dreams that we had

chorus

When times were tough, and you were down and out, who was there by your side
Now you've gone, I'm so tired of being alone with only your promises


The loneliness just fades away, thoughts of you just memories
No cryin' now for what we're missin', time won't forget what you meant to me

If only just for a moment, hold on to the dreams that we had
"
1991,98,Do You Want Me,Salt-n-Pepa,Hip hop,"You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

Do you really want me, baby Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up


Who me A tease Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

luck is believing you're lucky 
that's all and showing just a little bit of faith 

There's a soul in the city 
watching over us I swear 
There's a soul in the city 
there's a whole world waiting out there 

Listen 
I got plans for us 
playing like a skip on a record 
through my head all night long 
But when we walk that darkened stairway 
and step out on the roof 
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong 

Bring over some of your old Motown records 
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go 
on the roof and listen to the Miracles 
echo to the alley down below

1992,1,End of the Road,Boyz II Men,R&b,"Girl, you know we belong together
I don′t have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like thisYou'll be mine forever baby, you just wait

We belong together
And you know that I′m right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can′t sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I′d rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can′t let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can′t let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don′t realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I′ll forgive you
Maybe you′ll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go

Although we′ve come
Still I can't let go
It′s unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It′s unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don′t understand how much I love you do you?
I′m here for you

Just like you did baby but that's alright
And I′m still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day baby
Will you? Just come back to me

Baby please

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don′t let me go

Although we′ve come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It′s unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road

1992,2,Baby Got Back,Sir Mix-a-Lot,Hip hop,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys′ girlfriendsBut, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can′t believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She′s just so, black
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can′t deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she′s wearing
I'm hooked and I can′t stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
Ooh, Rump-o′-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I′ve seen her dancin′
To hell with romancin'
She′s sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo ′Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin′ flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
Shake that healthy butt
I like 'em round, and big
And when I′m throwin′ a gig
I just can't help myself, I′m actin' like an animal
Now here′s my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin′ bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot′s in trouble
Beggin′ for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin′ at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I′ll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin′ on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I′d rather stay and play
′Cause I'm long, and I′m strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back
Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain′t got nothin'
To do with my selection
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six
Ha ha, only if she′s 5'3
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain′t got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don′t want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don′t lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol′
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain′t down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I′m thinkin′ bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain′t it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn′t miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit ′em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back
Baby got back...

Sometimes the sun goes ′round the moon
I see the passion in your eyesSometimes it's all a big surprise

′Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it′s enough

And now we′re standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you′d make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you′re lookin' for
Is the one thing you can′t see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed

Break down the garden gate

The Khyber Pass to Vancouver′s lights
Knock me down, back up again

What about, what about

Do you, did you?
Remember the time

1992,21,This Used to Be My Playground,Madonna,Pop,"This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran toWhenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say?

Don′t look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why because life is short
And before you know you′re feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask

This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say?, no regrets

But I wish that you were here with me
Well then there′s hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You′re not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday

This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me

This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free

Wishing you were here with me

1992,22,Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,Patty Smyth,Rock,"Now I don′t wanna lose you
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don′t wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry

And that don′t really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losin′ my place
And I keep seein' you walk through that door

But there′s a danger in lovin' somebody too much
And its sad when you know it′s your heart you can't trust
There′s a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

Now I could never change you
An′ I don′t wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall

Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like the rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinkin′ something's gonna change

But there′s a danger in lovin' somebody too much
And its sad when you know it′s your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don′t stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain′t enough

And there's no way home
When it′s late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay

And there′s a danger in lovin' somebody too much
And it′s sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There′s a reason why people don′t stay who they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby sometimes love
It just ain′t enough
Oh, oh-ooh-oh
Enough

1992,23,Can't Let Go,Mariah Carey,R&b,"There you are
Holding her hand
I am lostDyin′ to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don′t you know
You were my life

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can′t let go

Just cast aside
You don′t even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don′t care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept

Even though I try
I can′t let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can′t let go

Do you even realize
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try
To deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

Even though I try
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You′re all I know
I can′t let you go

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You′re all I know

I came to win, battle me that′s a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back upTry and play the role and yo the whole crew′ll act up
If you′ve got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone′s talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk′s hoe
Feelin', funkin′, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin′ Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around!
Jump around!
Jump around!
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I′m smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible′s got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you′ll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain′t got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, ′cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

I′m the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, ′cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzanegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I′m coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I′ll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

That you will hear me say
That I will never run awayI am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you′re gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight?
Why can't we just let love decide?
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan?

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love


There will come a time
When love will blow your mind
And everything you′ll look for you'll find
That will be the time
That everything will shine
So bright it makes you colorblind

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?

1992,26,Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me,George Michael,,"I can′t light
No more of your darkness
All my picturesSeem to fade to black and white

I'm growing tired
And time stands still before me
Frozen here
On the ladder of my life

It′s much too late
To save myself from falling
I took a chance
And changed your way of life

But you misread
My meaning when I met you
Closed the door
And left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I′d just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can′t find
Oh, the right romantic line
But see me once
And see the way I feel

Don't discard me, baby don′t
Just because you think I mean you harm
Just because you think I mean you harm, oh
But these cuts I have, cuts I have
They need love, they need love, they need love to help them heal

Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it′s always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
′Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else that I see, yeah
I′d just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh

1992,39,Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,Progressive rock,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landsideNo escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

I′m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low

Mama
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger
Now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, oo-oo-oo
Didn′t mean to make you cry
If I′m not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I′ve got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I′d never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango?

Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro, magnifico, oh-oh-oh

I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He′s just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Oo-oo
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Tennessee, TennesseeTennessee, Tennessee

Lord, I′ve really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don′t know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull

My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you′re supposed to be my steering wheel

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me

Lord, it′s obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said ′cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty

The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Oh, won't you let me, won′t you help me
Won't you help me understand your plan
Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place
Take me home, home, you know I need to go home
Oh, yeah

Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let′s go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that′s okay, get it ′cause he's down to Earth

1992,42,Make It Happen,Mariah Carey,House,"Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my nameSo very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn′t even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still I had to keep on going

If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

1992,43,The One,Elton John,,"Goodbye England′s rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itselfWhere lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle′s burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation′s golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England′s greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England′s rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who′ll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England′s greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle′s burned out long before
Your legend ever will

1992,44,Set Adrift on Memory Bliss,P.M. Dawn,Hip hop,"Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me, baby you send meSet adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can′t remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that′s tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin′ about it
I don′t know, I doubt it

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, I let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They′re probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don′t think nothin' of me""
She was right, though, I can′t lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
So I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she′s not dreaming
She′s got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
′Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That′s the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me

In the darkness of your dreams

That you make it safe
Back to your own world
You′d better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day

They don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell
Back in your own world

Is it my turn to hold you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and you not hear me

Isn′t it amazing how some things just completely turn around?
So take every little piece of my heart
Yeah, take every little piece of my soul
Yeah, take every little bitty piece of my mind

Is saying everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same

Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave. I know

And the air outside′s so soft
Confessing everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

And it won′t matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won′t trouble me

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

Can′t keep his mind on nothin' else
He′d trade the worldFor the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs
He′d give up all his comforts

And sleep out in the rain
If she said that′s the way, it ought to be
When a man loves a woman

I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And baby baby please don′t treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul

She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels

′Cause baby, baby
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man

Will it make it easier on you now?You got someone to blame

1992,61,Keep on Walkin',CeCe Peniston,R&b,"My eyes are clouded
By the ghosts of a different life
When as a soldierI fought and cursed and cried
And now they′re staring
At a table brown and bare
And they're searching
For something that ain′t there

As the waitress comes and brings me another round
I don't say a word, I just stare down at the ground
Girl, whatever it is you're thinking
Don′t you look at me that way

Just keep on walkin′
My mind's a thousand miles away
And I ain′t talking
About what brought me here today
I just wanna be alone in a crowded room
Jukebox belting out songs about lovin' and drinkin′
Is that such a sin

Said she was leaving
'Cause I wasn′t the same man
And she took our children
'Cause she thinks that's right for them
Now I wonder
If I sit here long enough
Will I discover
Why I find it so damn tough

To grab the man I was
And turn him into me
Be the husband the father the friend
That I should be
Lord knows it′s right
But it′s trapped too deep inside

So I keep on walkin'
My heart′s a thousand miles away
And ain't no talking
Gonna take this hurt away
I wanna be somewhere in a room with you,
Dancin′ in the way we used to do
But I keep on walkin'

I′ve been trapped inside these walls I've built of silence
I can't let you in although I have been tryin′
I know what you want
But I can′t do it
Ain't got strength enough
To get me through it
Been holding on too long to let it go
God knows

But let′s go walkin'
You′ve got my heart right in your hand
And if we're talkin′
Maybe there's a chance
Of dancin' once again in a crowded room
Jukebox joining as we dream ′bout lovin′ and livin'
′Cause I won't give in
Let′s keep on walkin'

Hold on my heart
Throw me a lifeline
I′ll keep a place for you
Somewhere deep inside

So hold on my heart
Please tell her to be patient
'Cause there has never been a time
That I wanted something more

If I can recall this feeling
And I know there′s a chance
Oh, I will be there
Yes, I will be there
Be there for you
Whenever you want me to
Whenever you call
Oh, I will be there
Yes, I will be there

Hold on my heart

Right about this time, stay loose
Cool, chilled licks by one called, Arrested DevelopmentSay, come on, selectah, easy

See, I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right?
Just loud enough so folks could hear it′s hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation, maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease

Until a group of brothers started buggin′ out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored 'em ′cause, see, I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that′s good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

So they came to test Speech ′cause of my hairdo
And the loud bright colors that I wear
I was a target 'cause I′m a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing, brothers dissin′ it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
′Cause if I start to hit this man they′ll have to kill me! See?

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

I told the niggas, ""Please let us pass, friend""
I said ""Please"", 'cause I don′t like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain′t Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before, I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y′all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

You see

The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you step into
'Cause you might get killed, or shot, and it's not worth it

Would I keep running away?

In and out of hiding places

We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Besides that she had expectations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along comes Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date

And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life, the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself, ""There′s gotta be a better way""

Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW, a condo
Ron ended up a John Doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job, a good life, a good wife

A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big checks
Blame it on a black man, what the heck
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside

Little Tiffany, only thirteen
Came to the city, place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside

      They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is 
      It conquers all 
      But it's a mystery 

      1 - Love breaks your heart 
      Love takes no less than everything 
      Love makes it hard 

      And it fades away 
      So easily 

      In this world we've created 
      In this place that we live 
      In the blink of an eye babe, the darkness slips in 
      Love lights the world 
      Unites the lovers for eternity 

      2 - Love breaks the chains 
      Love aches for every one of us 
      Love takes the tears and the pain 
      And then turns it into the beauty that remains 

      Look at this place 
      It was paradise 
      But now it's dying 
      I'll pray for love 

      I'll take, my chances that it's not too late 




      And it fades away so easily 
      Oh Oh Oh
"
1993,22,Runaway Train,Soul Asylum,Alternative rock,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
I promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now,
I'm in too deep; there's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train, never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway trainAnd everything seems cut and dried,
Day and night, earth and sky,
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train, never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train, never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train, never coming back
Runaway train, tearing up the track
Runaway train, burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same

1993,24,Ditty,Paperboy,Hip hop,"Yo,  this  is  somethin'  comin'  from  the  nine  deuce  

Another  fat,  fat  track  So  Rhythm  D,  pour  the  orange  juice  

And  let's  relax  while  sippin'  on  yak  Because  it's  like  that  

I'm  causious  of  ho's,  so  Paperboy  wears  prophilatic  

I  wear  a  jimmy  for  the  skins  Cuz  it's  a  long  trip  

Front  row  seats,  aiyo  I  know  she's  on  the  nine  inch  

Just  to  get  a  peice  of  the  green  But  she's  an  undertaker  

Now  you  know  the  Paper  is  an  around  the  world  heart-breaker  

If  you  think  I  fell  for  yo,  had  to  have  a  breakdown  

Playin'  you  fools,  so  now  you  know  why  my  belly's  round  

Takin'  the  rap  back  up  and  scoopin'  up  crowds  just  like  a  steel  shovel 

Not  from  the  ghetto,  but  yo,  takin'  it  to  another  level  

Let  the  beat  ride,  but  hold  on  to  your  women,  G  

Cuz  now  that  I'm  rich  so  many  women  wanna  do  me  

It  make  a  man  say  ""damn""  

I'm  finally  taxin'  more  play  than  homey  Sam  

But  let  me  speak  to  the  weak,  I  mean  the  rookies  

My  time  is  help  up,  extremely  for  cookies  

Just  let  me  clock  this  groove  in  ninety  two  

Hey,  you  don't  bother  me  and  I  sure  'nuff  won't  bother  you  

And  ah,  you  just  watch  a  brother  flowin'  like  Niagra  

Think  before  you  step,  because  these  lyrics  just  might  stag  ya  

Although  I'm  labeled  with  the  black  fade  

It's  gold  d's  on  my  foreign  gold  lex,  cuz  I  got  it  made  

I  broke  the  beat  once  again  because  I  had  to  

And  just  like  Jody  Watley,  baby  girl,  I  can  have  you  

Just  let  me  work  this  track,  and  yo,  any  way  is  ok  

Your  place  or  mine,  all  night  until  the  next  day  

Unh  


Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  

Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  


Now  here  we  go  from  the  top  

Second  verse  of  the  same  song  

With  the  conclusion,  I  should  be  out  before  the  ding-dong.  

It's  just  a  mad  park  a  grip,  G  

It's  like  every  nickel  and  dime  nigga  be  like  

""See,  don't  you  remember  me?""  

A  hustler,  and  it's  on  with  more  hoes  to  play  low  

Keep  'em  chunky  like  Prego,  so  they  can  leggo  with  my  eggo  

I  have  a  tendancy  to  flow,  start  off  with  my  own  groove  

Pick  up  the  mic,  and  all  of  a  sudden,  I  see  high  movin'  

Guess  it's  like  magic,  and  Paperboy  is  the  magician  

If  I  was  a  vaccum  I'd  be  suckin'  up  competition  

Let  it  ride  again,  and  yo,  belive  I  got  my  own  thing  

Straight  Bahama  hoes  so  miss  me  with  the  chick  from  Soul  Train  

And  I'm  a  break  my  note,  just  to  show  up  token  

Tote  on  his  ass  when  I  scoop  him,  cuz  we  bud  smokin'  

A  black  man  tryin'  to  make  it  and  that  ain't  no  fair  

But  just  like  BeBe  and  CeCe,  I'll  take  you  there  

Huh  


Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  

Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  


Now  here  we  go  

Uh,  let's  take  a  trip  to  another  land  

Park  a  grip,  come  back  and  watch  the  hoes  tan  

Jump  in  the  lex-o,  and  roll  out  to  my  cabin  

Believe  me,  my  brother,  more  hoes  than  you  can  imagine  

All  on  the  ding-a-ling,  just  because  the  gold  rings  

But  I'm  like  a  supah  choke,  you  ain't  heard  a  damn  thing  

Make  sure  you  got  the  jim  hats,  strapped  for  protection  

Because  to  me,  my  life  is  more  than  my  erection  

And  give  me  a  hand,`if  you  a  fan,  it  ain't  over  yet  

Cuz  doin'  the  ditty  with  Paperboy  makes  the  ocean  sweat  

Leave  you  kinda  startled  like  the  funk  off  of  fritos  

Make  you  man  jealous,  while  hoes  cheese  like  Doritos  

It  ain't  my  fault,  I  lay  the  piper  with  concern  

And  I  ain't  from  Mount  Vernon,  but  a  brother's  money-earnin'  

And  for  those  disagree,  and  then  jack,  that's  a  pitty  

Just  bob  your  head  for  Paperboy  and  the  ditty  

Yeah  


Do  the  ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you  

Just  do  the  ditty-ditty  if  you  want  to  

Because  then  I  can  see  if  I  want  you

1993,25,Rhythm Is a Dancer,Snap!,Eurodance,"Chorus:
Rhythym is a dancer,
it's a soul's companion,
you can feel it everywhere

Lift your hands and voices
free your mind and join us
you can feel it in the air

Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, you can feel it in the air
Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh

back to top of chorus

A far away light in the futuristic place we might be,
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the kingdom of one
knowledgeable,
throw away the loneliness and head back down,
I'm going too fast, I'm going too fast

back to top of chorus

I plunge right on through the office door,
and into the arms of the bottomless negro of love,
suddenly I can't remember,
how to stop, or turn around,

Do I have to get behind myself,
Do I have to turn around before I can point,
I flip 'til I can breathe

1993,26,The River of Dreams,Billy Joel,Gospel,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
>From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Though the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

Princes, Princes who adore you
One has diamonds in his pockets

Got some big seal upon his jacket
Marry him, your father will condone you
Marry me, your father will disown you

Aww, marry him or marry me
I'm the one that loves you baby, can't you see
Ain't got no future or a family tree-
But I know what a Prince and lover ought to be
I know what a Prince and lover ought to be

Said, if you want to call me baby
An' if you want to tell me maybe
If you wanna buy me flowers
And if you want to talk for hours

1993,30,I Have Nothing,Whitney Houston,R&b,"Share my life, take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change all my colours for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me...
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you.

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of you love
I never knew love like I've known it with you 
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

1993,31,Mr. Wendal,Arrested Development,Hip hop,"Here, have a dollar,

in fact no brotherman here, have two

Two dollars means a snack for me,

but it means a big deal to you

Be strong, serve God only,

know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits

That's the poem I wrote for the first time

I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate

Mr.Wendal, that's his name,

no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one

Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,

until I had the chance to really get to know one

Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity

He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes

And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges,

still most of y'all come out confused




Mr.Wendal has freedom,

a free that you and I think is dumb

Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society

for Mr.Wendal's a bum

His only worries are sickness

and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase

Uncivilized we call him,

but I just saw him eat off the food we waste

Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no ?

Who are we to judge ?

When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved

and killed over a racist grudge

Mr.Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways

but we don't hear him talk

Is it his fault when we've gone too far,

and we got too far, cause on him we walk

Mr.Wendal, a man, a human in flesh,

but not by law

I feed you dignity to stand with pride,

realize that all in all you stand tall


Mr.Wendal, yeah yeah yeah, Lord, Mr.Wendal

1993,32,Have I Told You Lately,Rod Stewart,Celtic,"Have I told you lately that I love you 
Have I told you there's no one else above you 
Fill my heart with gladness 
take away all my sadness 
ease my troubles that's what you do 

For the morning sun in all it's glory 
greets the day with hope and comfort too 
You fill my life with laughter 
and somehow you make it better 
ease my troubles that's what you do 
There's a love that's divine 
and it's yours and it's mine like the sun 
And at the end of the day 
we should give thanks and pray 
to the one, to the one 

Have I told you lately that I love you 
Have I told you there's no one else above you 
Fill my heart with gladness 
take away all my sadness 
ease my troubles that's what you do 

There's a love that's divine 
and it's yours and it's mine like the sun 
And at the end of the day 
we should give thanks and pray

And have I told you lately that I love you 
Have I told you there's no one else above you 
You fill my heart with gladness 
take away my sadness 
ease my troubles that's what you do

ease my troubles that's what you do 
Take away all my sadness 
fill my life with gladness 
ease my troubles that's what you do

the lyrics

Hoo…ooh…

I've never been so sure
About anything before
But this loving feeling
Gonna be a feeling I feel forever more

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

Ho…oh…oh…oh…

You'll be my world
As long as there's a world turning 'round
And you'll be my heaven

Love is all you'll see
Loving you forever, baby
Living just to be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

Forever I'll be loving you
Long as time passes by
I'll be there beside you, ho
Through it all, I'll be standing by you

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be
Needing you here with me

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever, saving forever for you

You are the only one
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever, saving forever for you

You're the only one
Love for a lifetime won't do

1993,34,Ordinary World,Duran Duran,Soft rock,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights the TV and the radio but still I can't escape the ghost of you
What is happening to me crazy some would say
Where is the life that I recognize, gone away

And I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say pride will tear us both apart
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops runaway
Left me in the vaccuum of my heart
What is happening to me crazy some will say where is my friend when I need you most gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and grief
Fear today forgot tomorrow beside the news of holy war and holy need
Our's is just a little sorrowed talk, just blown away

And I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive
Any world is my world, every world is our world, every world

1993,36,I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That),Meat Loaf,Wagnerian rock,"And I would do anything for love, I'd run right into hell and back
      I would do anything for love, I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
        But I'll never forget the way you feel right now, oh no, no way
      And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, I won't do that
        Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
       I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, oh I won't do that
  Some days it don't come easy, and some days it don't come hard
    Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
    Some nights you're breathing fire, and some nights you're carved in ice
    Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again
    Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
    I know you can save me, no one else can save me now but you

      As long as the planets are turning, as long as the stars are burning
        As long as your dreams are coming true, you better believe it
      That I would do anything for love, and I'll be there til the final act
        I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
        But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight
        And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
    Oh I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that
            I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
            But I just won't do that
  Some days I pray for silence, and somedays I pray for soul
    Some days I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N Roll
    Some nights I lose the feeling, and some nights I lose control
 Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
    Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be
    There's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
  As long as the wheels are turning, as long as the fires are burning
    As long as your prayers are coming true, you better believe it
 That I would do anything for love, and you know it's true and that's a fact
    I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
    But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long
    And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
 I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no no no I won't do that
    I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
    But I just won't do that
   But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life, no way
     And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
     I would do anything for love
     But I won't do that
     No I won't do that
    Will you raise me up, will you help me down?
    Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
    Will you make it all a little less cold?
    I can do that! I can do that!
    Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
    Can you colorize my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
    Can you make it all a little less old?
    I can do that! Oh oh, now I can do that!
    Will you make me some magic, with your own two hands?
    Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
    Can you give me something I can take home?
    I can do that! Oh oh now, I can do that!
    Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
    Will ya hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
    Will you take me places I've never known?
    I can do that! Oh oh now, I can do that!    
    After a while you'll forget everything
    It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
    And you'll see that it's time to move on
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!
     I know the territory, I've been around
    It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
    And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
    I won't do that! No I won't do that!

    I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that

He took the words right out my mouth and walked a mile in my shoes
I've paid so many dues, I feel used and abused
And I'm.... so confused
umm, excuse me, for example
I'm the inspiration, for a WHOLE generation
And unless you got 10 SSsssticky Fingers
Its straight immitation
A figment, of your imagination
But but but but wait it gets worse!!

Comin thru wit a scam, a foolproof plan

Signed with a home tattoo happy birthday to you was created for ya

Can't I belive you're taking my heart too pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time might take a little crime to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone

Words playing me deja-vu like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chills is it something real or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces
Lost in a snow filled sky we'll make it alright to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need who do you love when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love when you come undone

In every single way, Hey!
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way! 
This ain't got shit to do wit shampoo
But watch your head n shoulders brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo I told ya a raid afraid of what I made
Plus played a funky fit so save ya flips
Plus tricks for that music plus the monkey bit. 
Triggas from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels
How the deal is that we're real so we're still around
Don't lamp wit a freestyle phantom ain't tryin' to be handsome 
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin' 
CHORUS: 
I live and die for Hip Hop 
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to Hip Hop so Hip Hop hooray...
Ho...Hey...Ho 
You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground 
Being low down I do the showdown wit' any little ho round, no! 
I wanna know who you're believing through you're funny reasons 
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said I know you're Mr. O.P.P. man yo PP man won't only see me man
You should've known that I was wit if a bit when I ain't hit it 
And step not to consider the Rep Heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker cause I'm Naughty by Nature
Not cause I hate cha!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
Even though I forgave ya when you had a spark. 
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love Black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today Hip Hop hooray...ho...hey!

There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's
Hip top today swerve what cha heard
Cause I ain't bailing no hey ain't choppin no crops
But still grownin ever day! 
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around. 
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your style is older than Lou Rawls!
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews wit shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty purr I call em sir too
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put my projects for boots step through troops and leave proof 
My problem solvers name is Mook!
I hittin' woodys in a hoody
Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood gee!

1993,46,Another Sad Love Song,Toni Braxton,,"Since you been gone

I been hangin' around here lately

With my mind messed up

Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind

Didn't help me

I guess I'm all messed up now baby

Soon as I jumped into my ride

Those memories start to play

A song comes on the radio

And there U are baby once again


It's just another sad love song

Rackin' my brain like crazy

Guess I'm all torn up

Be it fast or slow

It doesn't let go

Or shake me

And it's all because of you


Since you been gone

I keep thinkin' about you baby

Gets me all choked up

This heart of mine keeps

Dreamin' of you and it's crazy

You'd think I'd had enough

As soon as I get you out my head

I'm in your car again

Just one request from the radio

I'm back in love sugar once again


It's just another sad love song

Rackin' my brain like crazy

Guess I'm all torn up

Be it fast or slow

It doesn't let go

Or shake me

And it's all because of you


Here comes the strings

Then somebody sings

Only takes a beat

And then it starts killin' me darlin'

Only takes one note, I tell ya,

From that radio

It's just

Another

Lonely

Tell Me Will You Hold Me
When Wrong, Will You Skold Me
When Lost Will You Find Me

A Man Should Be Faithful
And Walk When Not Able
And Fight Till The End
But I'm Only Human

Everyone's Taking Control Of Me
Seems That The World's
Got A Role For Me
I'm So Confused
Will You Show To Me
You'll Be There For Me
And Care Enough To Bear Me








In Our Darkest Hour
In My Deepest Despair
Will You Still Care
Will You Be There
In My Trials
And My Tripulations
Through Our Doubts
And Frustrations
In My Violence
In My Turbulence
Through My Fear
And My Confessions
In My Anguish And My Pain
Through My Joy And My Sorrow
In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow

Hail to the conquerin' hero
There he goes with the girl he stole from me
Hail to the conquerin' hero
Look at him, he's as proud as he can be
He may think he's won the prize
But he doesn't realize
I'm not givin' her up so easily

Hail to the conquerin' hero
I suppose he'll be kissin' her tonight
Three cheers for the conquerin' hero
Marchin' off with my baby just for spite
While he is makin' with romance
I'll be planning an advance
I'm not givin' her up without a fight

For now I may retreat but I won't admit defeat
I'll show that guy I'm just as smart
Yeah, all's fair in love and war so I'll even up the score
I'll decorate him with a broken heart

Down with the conquerin' hero
Pretty soon I'll be ready to attack
I'll conquer the conquerin' hero
When I do, then I'll get my baby back
So he thinks the battle's done
But the battle's just begun
I'll be winnin' her back, just wait and see
And then that conquerin' hero   is gonna be me

I try all the time, in this institution 
And I pray, oh my god do I pray

Oh what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's goning to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby 
All that she wants - all that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants...

Wishing all my feelings was gone

I gave my best to you

Nothing for me to do

But have one last cry



One last cry

Before I leave it all behind

I gotta put you out of my mind this time

Stop living a lie

I guess I'm down to my last cry


Cry.....


I was here

You were there

Guess we never could agree

While the sun shines on you

I need some love to rain on me

Still I sit all alone

Wishing all my feelings was gone

Gotta get over you

Nothing for me to do

But have one last cry



One last cry

Before I leave it all behind

Been living a lie

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Every man wants a woman,

Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever

Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you?  Ha ha, please

Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around

at this old piano 
Trying hard to capture 
the moment this morning I don't know 
'Cause a bottle of vodka 
is still lodged in my head 
And some blond gave me nightmares 
I think she's still in my bed 
As I dream about movies 
they won't make of me when I'm dead 

With an ironclad fist I wake up and 
French kiss the morning 
While some marching band keeps 
its own beat in my head 
While we're talking 
About all of the things that I long to believe 
About love and the truth and 
what you mean to me 
And the truth is baby you're all that I need 

I want to lay you on a bed of roses 
For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails 
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is 
And lay you down on bed of roses 

Well I'm so far away 
That each step that I take is on my way home 
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night 
Just to see through this payphone 
Still I run out of time 
Or it's hard to get through 
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you 
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, 
baby blind love is true 

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses 
For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails 
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is 
And lay you down on bed of roses 

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry 
The barkeeper's wig's crooked 
And she's giving me the eye 
I might have said yeah 
But I laughed so hard I think I died 

When you close your eyes 
Know I'll be thinking about you 
While my mistress she calls me 
To stand in her spotlight again 
Tonite I won't be alone 
But you know that don't 
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove 
For it's you that I'd die to defend 

I want to lay you down on a bed of roses 
For tonite I sleep on a bed on nails 
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is 
And lay you down on bed of roses

And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize

To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love

Oh when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love


I've got to have a real love
Love so true and oh, baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer
To the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find a

It's a bird, it's a plane
Nope, it's Mary Jane, ain't a damn thing changed

Ya need a minute to think for whom ya better take
What up My time is up
Peace out to brooklyn 
Helpin' daddy-o hey yo, bring the verse in

So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall


You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I've been around the world and high and low
And still will never know
How it feels to have a real love

Because seems he can't be found

'Cause me and them ways have parted

That kind of love was the killin' kind 

Now listen

All I want is someone I can't resist

I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed


I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm tryin' to forget you

Love is sweet misery

I was cryin' just to get you

Now I'm dyin' cause I let you

Do what you do - down on me


Now there's not even breathin' room

Between pleasure and pain

Yeah you cry when we're makin' love

Must be one and the same


It's down on me

Yeah I got to tell you one thing

It's been on my mind

Girl I gotta say

We're partners in crime

You got that certain something

What you give to me

Takes my breath away

Now the word out on the street

Is the devil's in your kiss

If our love goes up in flames

It's a fire I can't resist


I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm tryin' to forget you

Your love is sweet misery

I was cryin' just to get you

Now I'm dyin' cause I let you

Do what you do to me


'Cause what you got inside

Ain't where your love should stay

Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love

If you give your heart away


I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm tryin' to forget you

Your love is sweet misery

I was cryin' just to get you

Now I'm dyin' just to let you

Do what you do what you do down to me, 

baby, baby, baby


I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm tryin' to forget you

Your love is sweet misery

I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm dyin' cause I let you

Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to

I was cryin' when I met you

Now I'm dyin' to forget you

Your love is sweet

I was cryin' when I met you

1993,62,What About Your Friends,TLC,New jack swing,"Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

What about your friends
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you

Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others 
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that clost to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friends is true they'll be there with you 
Through the thick and thin


Yo is it me, is it me or can it be I am a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically
'Cause I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy


People say I asc a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down 
Head underground, to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad 
and I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is goin insane

1993,66,Deeper and Deeper,Madonna,Dance-pop,"Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

Chorus:

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Bridge:

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why


The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me


Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again


Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do

Chorus:

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your


When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your


Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me, to love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain, I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like


Rain, I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like

I'll just step out on a mountaintop and wait for you to call my name. Rain

1993,74,Again,Janet Jackson,Pop,"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again

Yo.. uhh..

Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dog, no smog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Thinkin will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which park, are y'all playin basketball
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin niggaz everyway like M.J.

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.

Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder 
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger 
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
Drunk as hell but no throwin up 
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.

Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinkin about

And we are acting wild

And try to change the topic 
… Make profit 
So don't you even bother it 
Love is all what we are needing 
Our Earth is bleeding 
Hollywood is pleading 
To anyone that is believing 
… keep 
So none of us get hurting 
It's time for us to get right 
Forget the black and the white 
Just keeping love in sight 
Preaching every day and night

Why I wanna stay 
Love the answer 
I just don't know 
Why I wanna stay

Only, only with you

To escape the smog in this town
I will drive although I don't have a license
To escape the ideal that this city crowns

Hide every little scar with so much make-up
The skin can't even breathe
Hide every little scar or become the food they feed

Shift into a higher gear
Place the brick on the gas
On what I left behind I won't waste a tear
My rearview mirror has got broken glass

I will drive until I reach the desert
And wait until I see with my own eyes again
I will drive I'll head for the desert
And wait until our minds speak the same words as back then

This makes me into nothing in their eyes

And it goes a little something like this - hit it.
Mmm.....
Verse 1:
Can love him once but not twice
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
Verse 2:
Love can often hurt you
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up turn it loose
Turnin' it loose, baby

1993,87,Fields of Gold,Sting,,"You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in the fields of gold

So she took her love
For to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in the fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in the fields of gold
We'll walk in the fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold

1993,90,Reason to Believe,Rod Stewart,,"If I listened long enough to you 
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 

Someone like you makes it hard to live without 
somebody else 
Someone like you makes it easy to give 
never think about myself 

If I gave you time to change my mind 
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried 
Still I look to find a reason to believe 

If I listened long enough to you 
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true 
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried

1993,91,Break It Down Again,Tears for Fears,,"Break it down again
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Head a strong like a horse 
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of secrets
In the world of sound 
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
I want to break it down
Break it down again
So these are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force 
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of silence
In the world of sound 
"" No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
I want to break it down 
Horsin' around
Pray to power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
Play to the crowd
Play yeah yeah 
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you
With the ups and downs
I want to break it down
Break it down again 
Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down it again
No more sleepy dreaming

If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy
And you can trust me not to think
And not to sleep around
If you don't expect too much from me 
You might not be let down
Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy

1993,96,If I Ever Lose My Faith in You,Sting,,"You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
 You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
 You could say I lost my sense of direction
 You could say all of this and worse, but
 If I ever lose my faith in you
 There'd be nothing left for me to do

 Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
 You could say I lost my faith in the people on T.V.
 You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
 They all seemed like game show hosts to me
 If I ever lose my faith in you
 There'd be nothing left for me to do
 I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
 But every time I close my eyes, I see your face

 I never saw no miracle of science
 That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
 I never saw no military solution
 That didn't always end up as something worse,
 But let me say this first

 If I ever lose my faith in you
 If I ever lose my faith in you
 There'd be nothing left for me to do
 There'd be nothing left for me to do
 If I ever lose my faith
 If I ever lose my faith
 If I ever lose my faith

Is not good for you baby

And baby that's no lie, oh no

Tell me .. what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of a love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet, sweet
You're all I know and every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

And make you understand
Boy your love for me is all I need now
and more than I can stand
Oh well

How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
Boy you're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Well I keep loving you
More and more each time
Boy what am I gonna do
Cause you blown my mind, mind
I got the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

And it sure ain't gonna take the rest of my life
To keep ya, yeah, keep ya, happy

1993,100,Two Steps Behind,Def Leppard,,"Walk away if you want to 
it's ok, if you need to

I'll be two steps behind you

to turn around and I'll be two steps behind. 

Take the time 
to think about it 
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it 
Take a look around and see what you can find 
Like the fire that's burning up inside me, 
There's a magic running through your soul 
But you can't have it all 

I'll be two steps behind you

Will melt away

With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you′ll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don′t let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong

So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song

Lover is crying 'cause the other won′t stay

Some of us hover when we weep for the
Other who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I′m thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I′m clever
But that won′t take me anyhow or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, 'Hey, I can leave, I can leave′
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I miss you

You said you caught you ′cause you
Want me and one day you'll let me go
You′ll try to give away a keeper or keep me

Say goodbye to not knowing when
The truth in my whole life beganSay goodbye to not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

And I′ll remember the strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I′ll remember the way that you saved me
I'll remember

Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I′m standing on my own
I′ll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember

I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned to let go, I travel in stillness
And I′ll remember happiness

And I′ll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I′ll remember

1994,14,Whatta Man,Salt-n-Pepa,Soul,"Hey, hey
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man

I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although, most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
′Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it, because it's just pathetic
To let it, get me involved in that ""he said, she said"" crowd

I know that ain′t nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y′all, he's worth it
So, here′s to the future, 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep′
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep'
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn′t be him

He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he′ll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temp's
He′s not a fake wannabe trying to be a pimp
He dresses like a Dapper Don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Not to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See, other guys that I′ve had, they tried to play all that Mack shit
But every time they tried, I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he′s got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion

Yeah, the ritual, highway to Heaven
From 7 to 7, he's got me open like 7-11
And yes, it's me that he′s always choosing
With him, I′m never losing, and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He′s a mighty-mighty good man
Y'all don′t hear me? Now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a ""Wham! Bam! Thank you, ma′am!"" He′s a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose-pimples with every single touch

Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood ′cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter, and he′ll knock another out
Don't take him for a sucker ′cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He′s a mighty-mighty good man
Now break it down, break it down, one time

What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man...

And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying

And the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars just like thunder

1994,18,Can You Feel the Love Tonight,Elton John,Pop,"There′s a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It′s enough for this wide eyed wanderer

That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There′s a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There′s a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star crossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it′s laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls ain′t no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin′ dice, so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What′s up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats, so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin′ me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard, they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckers all in his mix

I′m gettin′ jacked, I'm breakin′ myself
I can't believe they takin′ Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said, ""Damn, what′s next?""

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of 'em see him if they going straight pound for pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head, I think I′m goin′ down
I can't believe this happenin′ in my own town

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin′, it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I′m switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ′cause it′s on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G-child
We're in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said, ""My car′s broke down, and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls, and it's goin′ real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking, into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody
G-funk, where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know

You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin′ like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you, but I lied

How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep, so true

So many reasons in so many ways

Need you forever and I need you to stay

Don′t be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart, my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence

The return to innocence

And if you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself, don′t hide
Just believe in destiny

Don't care what people say

1994,34,All I Wanna Do,Sheryl Crow,Country pop,"Hit it
This ain′t no disco
It ain't no country club eitherThis is L.A.

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It′s apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he′s plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he′s ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

′Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I′m not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I′m not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches, and the Buds, and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I′m not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won′t tell you, that you're the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

And I started, started pretending

But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey, baby but just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer but could not walk
And I think of it every night
How I just could not get it right
Oh, if we ever come close again
I know what I'll say then
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name

Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
And maybe I′m lonely, that′s all I'm qualified to be
That′s just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do...

Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with Holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I′ve never known?

It'll all turn to dust, and we′ll all fall down
Sooner or later, you′ll be screwin' around

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Baby′s in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat

Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin′ all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
′Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One′s on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job

The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it′s hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can′t relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
That's choking on the splinters

The love I thought I′d won
You give for free

1994,61,Keep Ya Head Up,2Pac,Hip hop,"Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don′t nobody else care
And I, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don′t forget, girl, keep ya head up

And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don′t believe him
And if he can′t learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don′t need him
And I ain't tryin′ to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see ′em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy

And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we′ll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies

And since a man can′t make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin′ like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two

And I realise Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I′d rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of 15 cents
It′s hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I′m headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they′re blowin' in the wind

Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It′s gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin′ wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor

Say there ain′t no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain′t no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain′t meant to survive, 'cause it′s a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh
You got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it′s kinda rough and you′re feelin' all alone
Daddy′s long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
′Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more

′Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don′t love him no more
You can′t complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there′s too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you′re lookin' fearless

While tears is rollin′ down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
′Cause if it did, you couldn′t take it
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn′t make it
And now my son's gettin′ older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders

While the rich kids is drivin′ Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin′ friends
And it′s crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep ya head up

1994,75,Dreams,Gabrielle,British soul,"Now there you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It′s only right that you should play it the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had

And what you lost

And what you had

And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they′re playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know,
You'll know, you′ll know

Now here I go again I see a crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It′s only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it′s raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you′ll know,
You'll know

All we had and all we lost
All we had and all we lost

Niggas is mad I get more butt than ash trays
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga ransom notes
Far from handsome, but damn a nigga tote
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you′re wack to me
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics, the shit is
Depressing, pathetic, please forget it
You're mad cause my style you′re admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring
You shoulda been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle you're bound to get shot
Not from Houston but I rap-a-lot
Pack the gat a lot
The flav′s bout to drop uh

Word up, no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me
I′m straight rap great
Busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting, like the toe on Pro Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme
Plus I climb, word is bond
Your album couldn′t fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now I reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut, did your girl′s butt
I scraped it, shaped it, now she won't strut
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith
You won′t be around next year
My rap′s too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts
You're fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man, that′s it
Now you got to get your dome split
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, yes I'm just cool like dat
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
I′m gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

Burn ′em in the flames


Hee-shee, uh blowticious
Skeevee, delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good

I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It′s all for you, it's really all for you
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don′t cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it′s Busta Rhymes the great

Yo yo, hey hey hey

Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches

I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don′t you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world
Least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up

U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from infinity to infinity
Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there′s exceptions to this rule
Now don′t be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don′t you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I′m talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said ""Who you calling a bitch?""
I hit the bottom, there ain′t nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work, give you an attitude then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I′ll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I′m nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don′t really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that′s not what I′m here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don′t hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you call yourself
A ""Gangsta Bitch"" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There′s plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain′t none of this work getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your
Homegirl, right? Bucking with nobody

And I′ll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain′t no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We′ll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

I′ll be there 'til the stars don′t shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don′t rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Always, always

1994,93,Back in the Day,Ahmad,West coast hip hop,"Intro:

Jerome! jerome! put on that bobby womack!
Nah girl I wanna go way back, ahh yeah check this out
*Needle is put to the groove on a dusty record*

Back in the days when I was young I′m not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days

Verse one:

When I just a little niggerole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin along
Naggin if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y′all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin the blues
Sayin ""yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungaloes
Then switch to playin ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin gazelles
If they really had money raised be sportin bk′s
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminesce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus:

Back in the days when I was young I′m not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Verse two:

I′m still back in the days, but now the year is '87
′88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high

But let me finish this reminescin and tellin
Bout when girls was bellin tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, nike court airs, and footsie socks
And eatin pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I′m glad ′cause when j.j. fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushes on they asses
Dudes, had on nike suits, and the pumas with
The fat laces, 'cause it was either that or k-swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin all I had to do now, was finish homework
It′s true, you don't realize really what you got til it′s gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminesce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus


Verse three:

Well, it′s the niggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I′m holdin
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin
You steady bobbin your head and I′m paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in south central l.a.
That′s where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I′m first
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminesce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Chorus

1994,98,And Our Feelings,Babyface,R&b,"We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn′t last
Now they wonder why we didn't last

We fell in love, it seemed so righteous
Couldn′t compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion
From people who don't know, who don′t know

We fell apart, the bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared, they didn′t help
Makes me wonder, should we blame ourselves?

So here we are, broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody said to let it end
Well it makes me wonder we can't let them win

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion
From people who don't know

If we′d only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we should've done
We′d both be here still making love

I wanna know that
That we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words that come from whispers
From people we don′t know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They′re just words without emotion

Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam
She'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping
At all 'cause he can't seem to keep
His self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and lakes that
You're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way
Or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is baby it's good to me
One day he goes and takes a glimpse
In the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me


I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like His promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how you get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how you get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how you get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family

1995,8,Take a Bow,Madonna,Orchestral pop,"Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
Say your lines but do you feel them
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star

Chorus:

You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye


Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
Wish you well, I cannot stay
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star



But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye


Say good-bye

1995,10,This Is How We Do It,Montell Jordan,New jack swing,"This is how we do it 
La ra ra ra ra ra... 

This is how we do it. 
It's Friday night, and I feel all right 
The party is here on the West side 
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up 
Designated driver take the keys to my truck 
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded 
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!"" 
It feels so good in my hood tonight 
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani 
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by 
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid 
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up 
And let me hear the party say 

1- I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because 
   South Central does it like nobody does 
   To all my neighbors you got much flavor 
   Let's flip the track, bring the old school back 

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air 
And wave them from here to there 
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player 
You see the hood's been good to me 
Ever since I was a lower-case G 
But now I'm a big G. The girls see I got the money 
A hundred-dollar bills y'all 

If you were from where I'm from then you would know 
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck 
You can get yours in a '64 

Whatever it is, the party's underway 
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up 
And let me hear the party say 

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because 
South Central does it like nobody does 
YNV, SCC, all my homies 
I'll never come wack on an old school track 

Rap:

Check it out! 
Once upon a time in '94 
Montell made no money and life sure was slow 
All they said was 6'8"" he stood 
And people thought the music that he made was good 
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name 
He came up to Monty, this is what he said 
You and OG are gonna make some cash 
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

1995,12,Water Runs Dry,Boyz II Men,R&b,"We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say I love you no more
Cause sayin' how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

Until the dawn and we can pump pump 

All through the night 'till the early morn 

Come along I'll take you around the 'hood 

On a gangsta lean 

'Cause we can pump pump any time of day

You got to keep it up now there you go

1995,16,Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?,Bryan Adams,Latin rock,"To really love a woman 
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside 
Hear every thought - see every dream 
N' give her wings - when she wants to fly 
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms 
Ya know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman you tell her 
that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her 
that it's gonna last forever 
So tell me have you ever really 
- really really ever loved a woman? 

To really love a woman 
Let her hold you - 
til ya know how she needs to be touched 
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her 
Til you can feel her in your blood 
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes 
Ya know ya really love a woman 

When you love a woman 
you tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one 
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her 
that you'll always be together 
So tell me have you ever really - 
really really ever loved a woman? 

You got to give her some faith - hold her tight 
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right 
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you 
Ya really gotta love your woman...

1995,17,Always,Bon Jovi,Rock,"This romeo is bleeding 
But you can't see his blood 
It's nothing but some feelings 
That this old dog kicked up 

It's been raining since you left me 
Now I'm drowning in the flood 
You see I've always been a fighter 
But without you I give up 

Now I can't sing a love song 
Like the way it's meant to be 
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore 
But baby, that's just me 

And I will love you, baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 
I'll be there till the stars don't shine 
Till the heavens burst and 
The words don't rhyme 
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind 
And I'll love you - Always 

Now your pictures that you left behind 
Are just memories of a different life 
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry 
One that made you have to say goodbye 
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair 
To touch your lips, to hold you near 
When you say your prayers try to understand 
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man 

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near 
When he says the words you've been needing to hear 
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine 
To say to you till the end of time 

Yeah, I will love you baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 

If you told me to cry for you 
I could 
If you told me to die for you 
I would 
Take a look at my face 
There's no price I won't pay 
To say these words to you 

Well, there ain't no luck 
In these loaded dice 
But baby if you give me just one more try 
We can pack up our old dreams 
And our old lives 
We'll find a place where the sun still shines 

And I will love you, baby - Always 
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always 
I'll be there till the stars don't shine 
Till the heavens burst and 
The words don't rhyme 
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind 
And I'll love you - Always

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

And I'll come runnin'

could not believe

And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person not just a black man

      Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
      Come roll in all the riches all around you
      And for once, never wonder what they're worth

      The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
      The heron and the otter are my friends

      Can you paint with all the colors of the wind ?
      Can you paint with all the colors of the wind ?

      How high does the sycamore grow ?
      If you cut it down, then you'll never know

      And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
      For whether we are white or copper-skinned
      We just sing with all the voices of the mountain

      You can paint with all colors of the wind

1995,39,As I Lay Me Down,Sophie B. Hawkins,Pop,"It felt like spring time on this February morning 
In the courtyard birds were singing your praise 
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel 
Alright I carried them with me today now 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
I feel so high though I am not above the sorrow 
Heavy hearted 'till you call my name 
And it sounds like church bells or the whistle of a train 
On a summer evening I'll run to meet you barefoot 
Barely breathing 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

It's not too near for me 
Like a flower I need the rain 
Though it's not clear to me 
Every season has its change 
And I will see you 
When the sun comes out again 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
And I will wake up happy 
So I pray

Just tilt my sun towards

Your cup runneth over again.

Don't scream about
Don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby 
Just spit me out
Don't worry about
Don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am.
Don't throw away your basic needs,
Ambiance and vanity.

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

Baby

Lately, I've been thinking something's going wrong
'Cause you got an attitude
And you're not in the mood like you used to
Girl, I can feel it when I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
Can I be the one to blame?

I don't wanna lose your love, mmm
I don't wanna say bye-bye, oh no no 
True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine, and mine

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We make sweet love
Baby, I know you feel it, too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I'm so certain of

It's always the little things, I remember
And I can't just let it slip away
Slip away 

Teddy, won't you play the music for me
Teddy, won't you play Backstreet side?
Baby I get so lonely
Sometimes, I...
Baby my heart is broken sometimes
I need you right now, I don't...
I can't let you slip away, slip away

I don't see it being a problem
If I just get one little bitty kiss baby...
I just can't let you get away, oh yeah...

The kind of girl you that you could be down for 

Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me 

That your the kind of guy that I should make a move on 

And if I don't let you know 

Then I won't be for real 

I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on 

The more I see you the more that it becomes so true 

There ain't no other for me it's only you



I wanna be down 

With what you're going through 

I wanna be down 

I wanna be down with you 

No matter what time of day or night it's true 

I wanna be down


I know anybody's gonna be lonely 

Without the reason they got someone to care for 

Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on 

If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of 

If all you need is the time that I got plenty of 

I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby 

I wanna stay by your side 

Be there to call you up 

And let you know everything will be all right




Yeah oh

Yeah, oh

1995,51,"Dear Mama"" / ""Old School",2Pac,Hip hop,"You are appreciated 


When I was young me and my mama had beef 
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets 
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face 
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place 
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool 
with the big boys, breakin all the rules 
I shed tears with my baby sister 
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids 
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama 
When things went wrong we'd blame mama 
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell 
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell 
And who'd think in elementary? 
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day 
And runnin from the police, that's right 
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside 
And even as a crack fiend, mama 
You always was a black queen, mama 
I finally understand 
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man 
You always was committed 
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it 
There's no way I can pay you back 
But the plan is to show you that I understand 
You are appreciated 


Lady... 
Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady 
Dear mama 
Place no one above ya, sweet lady 
You are appreciated 
Don't cha know we love ya? 



Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair 
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there 
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger 
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger 
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along 
I was lookin for a father he was gone 
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs 
They showed a young brother love 
I moved out and started really hangin 
I needed money of my own so I started slangin 
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks 
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox 
I love payin rent when the rent's due 
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 
Cause when I was low you was there for me 
And never left me alone because you cared for me 
And I could see you comin home after work late 
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate 
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given 
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin 
But now the road got rough, you're alone 
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own 
And there's no way I can pay you back 
But my plan is to show you that I understand 
You are appreciated 



Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama 
I can always depend on my mama 
And when it seems that I'm hopeless 
You say the words that can get me back in focus 
When I was sick as a little kid 
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did 
And all my childhood memories 
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me 
And even though I act craaazy 
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me 
There are no words that can express how I feel 
You never kept a secret, always stayed real 
And I appreciate, how you raised me 
And all the extra love that you gave me 
I wish I could take the pain away 
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day 
Everything will be alright if ya hold on 
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on 
And there's no way I can pay you back 
But my plan is to show you that I understand 
You are appreciated 


Sweet lady 
And dear mama 

Dear mama

And everything that I've got you can have

But still you feel like you're on your own 
Can you see through your tears

And you're not out there all alone

Hold On,'till you feel a little stronger 
Hold On to me

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

I used to know this girl that slanged the green shit
Had it all goin on, but it didn't mean shit
She wanted to be a star, with big cars
and all the fame that came my way I gotta say
that she was all that, and a bag of indo
with no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Aiyyo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran
Had all the holy books, and notes to get still
I never met another dealer with that appeal
With those electric eyes, hypnotized
any wise man surprised, the queen of the lye

Bee eyes, bouncin five deep, clicked of innocence
Hangin with friends, all under surveillance from the government
While Don want tights they floss rights, just chewin on ice
Meditatin with her camp, gettin damp
She's a pimp or tile freak bitch, high maintenance
She got her fuckin clit pierced, chained to her anus
Professional for wettin niggaz up, suck em first
til they bust, swallow nut, then she's quick to strut
right out the projects, been a whore since ninety-one
Suck a niggaz dick for fun, holdin guns in her buns
Type of chick tell you 'fuck me in the ass' talkin shit
While she goin WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA on your dick

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

Yeah since I seen the queen of green on the screen
So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
or better yet like a fiend, who need a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., _Tougher Than Leather_
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature
SkyPager turned off, datin one of the Lakers
Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
but her sister's, bangin too, what should I do
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Plantin my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playin the second string, on the squad
I'm blowin up, all in your face, word to God

Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
it made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fuckin dick is throbbin
She started slobbin and gogglin, spittin burblin burpin it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
was a motherfuckin work of art, she rode my dick
just like a Kawasaki til the pussy started soundin sloppy
like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
on her face in between her lips
Then she started lickin it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich.. damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

Is it everything you hoped it'd be

The right time to roll to me 
Look into your heart pretty baby, 
Is it aching with some nameless need. 
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it 
Right then, roll to me 
And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair 
So if you want to talk the night through 
Guess who will be there? 
So don't try to deny it pretty baby, 
You've been down so long you can hardly see 
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining

The right time to roll to me

1995,59,Believe,Elton John,Symphonic music,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 

I believe in love, it's all we got 
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch 
War makes money, cancer sleeps 
Curled up in my father and that means something to me 
Churches and dictators, politics and papers 
Everything crumbles sooner or later 
But love, I believe in love 

I believe in love, it's all we got 
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross 
Love is simple, hate breeds 
Those who think difference is the child of disease 
Father and son make love and guns 
Families together kill someone 
Without love, I believe in love 

Without love I wouldn't believe 
In anything that lives and breathes 
Without love I'd have no anger 
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here 
Without love I wouldn't believe 
I couldn't believe in you 
And I wouldn't believe in me 
Without love 

I believe in love 
I believe in love 
I believe in love

1995,60,Carnival,Natalie Merchant,,"I've walked these streets
a virtual stage
it seemed to me
make up on their faces
actors took their
places next to me 

I've walked these streets
in a carnival
of sights to see
all the cheap thrill seekers
the vendors and the dealers
they crowded around me 

have I been blind
have I been lost
inside my self and
my own mind
hypnotized
mesmerized
by what my eyes have seen 

I've walked these streets
in a spectacle of wealth and poverty
in the diamond markets
the scarlet welcome carpet
that they just rolled out for me 

I've walked these streets
in the mad house asylum
they can be
where a wild eyed misfit prophet
on a traffic island stopped
and he raved of saving me 

have I been blind
have I been lost
inside my self and
my own mind
hypnotized
mesmerized
by what my eyes have seen 

have I been wrong
have I been wise
to shut my eyes
and play along
hypnotized
paralyzed

by what my eyes have seen

have I been blind
have I been lost
inside my self and
my own mind
hypnotized
mesmerized
by what my eyes have found

Ist glaub' ich Zeit 

Hab' ein Bild von Dir neben mir 

Dein Lippenstiftabdruck noch auf dem Kaffeepokal - oja 

Hab' 'ne Faust pure Emotion 

Hab' im Kopf kaputte Träume 

Muß sie lassen, muß sie lassen hinter mir nun 


Was immer ich sagte, was immer ich tat ich's nicht so meinte 

Ich will Dich zurück für gut 

Wann immer ich bin falsch erzähl mir das Lied und ich sing' es 

Du bist rechts und bist erfahren 


Unbemerkt obwohl unterstrichen hab' ich kapiert die Geschichte 

Sie war nicht gut! 

Doch in der Ecke von mein' Hirn ich feierte Ehre 

Doch das war nicht zu sein 

In der Biegung unserer Trennung Du warst besser in sein frei 

Findst Du nicht 'n kleinen Raum drin für mich? 


Was immer ich sagte, was immer ich tat ich's nicht so meinte 

Ich will Dich zurück für gut 

Wann immer ich bin falsch erzähl mir das Lied und ich sing' es 

Du bist rechts und bist erfahren 


Und wir werden sein zusammen, diesmal für immer 

Wir werden kämpfen und für immer wird es sein 

So komplett in unserer Liebe 

Wir werden nie wieder unbedeckt sein 


Was immer ich sagte, was immer ich tat ich's nicht so meinte 

Ich will Dich zurück für gut 

Wann immer ich bin falsch erzähl mir das Lied und ich sing' es

1995,67,All I Wanna Do,Sheryl Crow,Country pop,"Hit it!

This ain't no disco

It ain't no country club either

This is LA!


""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""

Says the man next to me out of nowhere

It's apropos of nothing

He says his name's William but I'm sure

He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me

And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday

In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world are washing their cars

On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing

As best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks

Back to the phone company, the record store too

Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause


All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard


I like a good beer buzz early in the morning

And Billy likes to peel the labels

From his bottles of Bud

He shreds them on the bar

Then he lights every match in an oversized pack

Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers

Before blowing and cursing them out

And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar

Dangerously close to one another

The bartender looks up from his want ads


All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard


Otherwise the bar is ours,

The day and the night and the car wash too

The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars

The sun and the moon but


All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun

Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

1995,71,Secret,Madonna,R&b,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

Chorus:

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for


I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for


Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden

1995,73,Feel Me Flow,Naughty by Nature,Hip hop,"You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
lyrically splittin dismissin
I'm on a mission of just hitting
now it's written and kitten hittin wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are 
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really
1-So here we go now, 
  Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin.
On nothin splittin things that's bitten
And gettin written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else 
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye.
The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's 
The wetter flow that'son point like
Decimals manhandlin new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew
Looking for the pink in poo poo.
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jammin ta while we plannin ta jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin damagin mics
Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertibrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up. 
Shakes shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like your with us if not zip up 
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard 
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters 
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies 
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty.

1995,75,The Sweetest Days,Vanessa Williams,Pop,"You and I in this moment
      Holding the night so close
      Hanging on, still unbroken
      While outside the thunder rolls
      Listen now, you can hear our heartbeat
      Warm against life's bitter cold
      These are the days
      The sweetest days we'll know 
      There are times that scare me
      We rattle the house like the wind
      Both of us so unbending
      We battle the fear within
      All the while, life is rushing by us
      Hold it now and don't let go 
      These are the days
      The sweetest days we'll know 

      So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
      Watching the stars till they're gone
      And when even the memories have all faded away
      These days go on and on 

      Listen now, you can hear our heartbeats
      Hold me now and don't let go
      These are the days
      The sweetest days we'll know

Da da da da 

Da da da da 



I'm young but I'm wise 

Enough to know that you 

Don't fall in love over night 

That's why I thought if I 

Took my time that everything 

In love would be right 

But as soon as I closed my eyes 

I was sayin' to love Goodbye



But I guess I'm 

Lonely brokenhearted 

Life's not over 

I can start again 

While I'm lonely brokenhearted 

It's a hurting thing to get over


No more empty conversation 

Next time I will be totally sure 

Don't want the pain of falling 

In and out of love 

It's more than my poor heart should endure 

So I listen to all the advice 

And remember each time I cry




While I'm lonely brokenhearted 

Life's not over 

I can start again 

While I'm lonely brokenhearted 

It's a hurting thing to get over 

Da Da Da 

Oh Ya 

Da Da Da Da Da 

Wow Ya 

A Da, Oohh


I listen to all the advice 

And remember each time I cry


Only brokenhearted 

Life's not over 

I can start again 

While I'm lonely brokenhearted 

It's a hurting thing to get over


Lonely brokenhearted 

Life's not over 

I can start again 

While I'm lonely brokenhearted

You wear it like a rash

There's a crowd to cry 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me

They'll go down on one knee 
But they'll want their money back 
If you're alive at thirty-three 
And you're turning tricks 
With your crucifix 
You're a star

You don't have to deny love 
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me

I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your
Love to me at all
I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even want to hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothin' good is gonna come 'til you change
Change your ways
Until you change your evil ways
Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breakin' my heart
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel
I don't understand why you've been so wrong
I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise so
We could get along
I gave my love to you despite
Your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me there's only
One thing left to say
There's a time when you know what you
Feel inside your heart
It's tellin' you that somethin' feels strange
You don't have to deny it
All you gotta do is just try it
You'll find our love grows
Stronger if you're willing to change

Tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Tell me does she want you infatuate and haunt you
Does she know just how to shock and electrify and rock you
Does she inject you seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do

Can I survive all the implications
Even if I tried could you be less than an addiction
Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg steal and lie fight kill and die
Just to hold you hold you like I do

Tell me does she love you like the way I love you

Wo kommst Du her, du Baumwollaugen-Jupp?

Er ritt durch die Felder, so hübsch und so stark 

Die Augen war'n sein Werkzeug 

Und das Lächenln seine Wumme 

Aber alles wofür er kam war haben bißchen Spaß 


Er brachte Desaster wo immer er ging 

Die Herzen der Mädel er puttgemacht hat 

Alle rannten weg, so daß keiner je wußte 

Übrig blieb immer der Baumwollaugen-Jupp

Wir könn' zwar nicht singen doch das ist okay

Und das tut manchmal weh!

Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there

All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure enough couldn't have survived without you

I know one thing that never changes and 

That's you as my best friend


Whenever I'm down 

With all that's going on, It's really going on 

Just one of those days 

You say the right thing, to keep me moving 

To keep me going strong, what else can I say


Friends are there through thick and thin 

Well I've been told that 

And I believe that it's automatic 

Call me when you need a friend 

Cuz I'm your sister and always for ya and I don't know




I'll be there for you 

When you're going through, 

wouldn't you be my friend 

Friend you can count on me

1995,99,Misery,Soul Asylum,Alternative rock,"They say misery loves company
We could start a company and make misery

Frustrated, Incorporated
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

Put me out of my misery
I'd do it for you, would you do it for me
We will always be busy making misery

We could build a factory and make misery
We'll create the cure; we made the disease

Frustrated, Incorporated
Frustrated, Incorporated
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to feel

Put me out of my misery
All you suicide kings and you drama queens
Forever after happily, making misery

Did you satisfy your greed, get what you need
Was it only envy, so empty

1996,2,One Sweet Day,Mariah Carey,R&b,"Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared


Although the sun will never shine the same again
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray


Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say

For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am

If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again

1996,8,I Love You Always Forever,Donna Lewis,Pop,"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rain come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stilness, soft spoken words
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever

1996,12,Missing,Everything but the Girl,Deep house,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And pass your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were
Two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind
While you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you
Shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train
I ask
Why did I come again?
Can I confess
I've been hanging'round
Your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing
Since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on
And I miss you-
Like the deserts miss the rain

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought...it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought

When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic...dontcha think
A little too ironic...and yeah I really do think...

It's like rain on your wedding day

When there are words unspoken 
In your soul there's

A place you know 
A familiar face 
Somewhere to go 
You should look inside yourself 
You're halfway there

I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
So what the hell now, we've already been forever damned
Anywhere you go I'll follow you down...

How do you want it? How do you feel? 
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game 
livin in the fast lane; I'm for real 


Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out 
Got a nigga wantin it so bad I'm bout to pass out 
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it 
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it 
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin 
Body talkin shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning 
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance 
Doin eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can 
Forgive me i'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man 
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man 
Mr. International, playa with the passport 
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for 
It's either him or me -- champagne, Hennessey 
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies 
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need 
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need 
Approachin hoochies with a passion, been a long day 
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way 
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it 
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it 



Tell me is it cool to fuck? 
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what? 
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic 
cause I'm somewhat psychotic 
I'm hittin switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics 
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya 
I ain't quittin til the show is over, cause I'ma rider 
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak 
and let you get on top of me, get her rockin these 
Nights full of Alize, a livin legend

Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker 
Instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother 
Worse than the others -- Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole 
You're too old to understand the way the game is told 
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts 
Want some on lease? I'm makin millions, niggaz top that 
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell 
livin in hell -- only a few of us'll live to tell 
Now everybody talkin bout us I could give a fuck 
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss 
Nigga tell me how you want it 



Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop 
on how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof

1996,18,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,Celine Dion,Soft rock,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
Al coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

And when you kiss me like this
And when I touch you like that
If you do it like this
And if we...

1996,19,Change the World,Eric Clapton,Country,"If I can reach the stars,
Pull one down for you,
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth:

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems.
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams.

And I can change the world,
I will be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.

And if I could be king,
Even for a day,
I'd take you as my queen;
I'd have it no other way.

And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made.
Till then I'd be a fool,
Wishing for the day...

That I can change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

I could change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

1996,20,Hey Lover,LL Cool J,Hip hop,"I've been watchin' you from afar,
for as long as I can remmeber
You are all a real man can need
and ever ask for
this is love
this is more than a crush

I saw with your man
smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coup with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
so skated off, as you strolled off
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mision
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
and I've been working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
but i don't want ta violate your relationship 
so i lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
still he can't stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with huh vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover


Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unities our souls
togehter we swim until the point of no control
so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time

1996,22,Insensitive,Jann Arden,,"How do you cool your lips 
after a summer's kiss 
how do you rid the sweat 
after the body bliss 
How do you turn your eyes 
from the romantic glare 
how do you block the sound 
of a voice you'd know anywhere 
Oh, I really should have known 
by the time you drove me home 
by the vagueness in your eyes 
casual good-byes 
by the chill in your embrace 
the expression on your face 
that told me 
you might have some advice to give 
on how to be 
insensitive 
How do you numb your skin 
after the warmest touch 
how do you slow your blood 
after the body rush 
how do you free your soul 
after you've found a friend 
how do you teach your heart 
it's a crime to fall in love again 
Oh, you probably won't remember me 
it's probably ancient history 
I'm one of the chosen few 
who went ahead and fell for you 
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch 
I fell too fast, I feel too much 
I thought that you might have 
some advice to give on how to be 
insensitive

1996,24,Name,Goo Goo Dolls,Alternative rock,"And even though the moment passed me by 
I still can't turn away 
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose 
Got tossed along the way 
And letters that you never meant to send 
Got lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans 
And never knew their names 
We don't belong to no one 
That's a shame
But you could hide beside me 
Maybe for a while 
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far 
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be a star
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast 
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history 
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name 
And I won't tell 'em your name 
I won't tell em' your name 
Oooh, oooh, oooh
I won't tell em' your name
Ow!

I think about you all the time 
But I don't need the same 
It's lonely where you are
Come back down 
And I won't tell 'em your name

1996,25,Who Will Save Your Soul,Jewel,,"People living their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
Another burger, another hot dog, some fries
A wish in the well, hope your health don't go to hell, well
Another doctor's bill, another lawyer's bill
Another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flower
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own
We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower
Went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different God's as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll
That we forget to begin
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flower
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own
Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
You got social security, but that don't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, say you're o.k. for today,
You say that you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swel, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut,
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust you butts.
Who will save you soul when it comes to the flower
Who will save you soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save you own

1996,28,Counting Blue Cars,Dishwalla,Alternative rock,"Must of been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and
He walked with a purpose
In his sneakers, down the street
He had, many questions
Like children often do
He said,
 Tell me all your thoughts on God? 
 Tell me am I very far? 

Must of been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars
Skip the cracks, in the street
And ask many questions
Like children often do
We said,
 Tell me all your thoughts on God?
 'Cause I would really like to meet her.
And ask her why we're who we are.
Tell me all your thoughts on God,
Cause I am on my way to see her.
So tell me am I very far -
Am I very far now? 

Its getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many, cross eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do

 Tell me all your thoughts on God?
'Cause I would really like to meet her.
And ask her why we're who we are.
Tell me all your thoughts on God?
'Cause I am on my way to see her.
So tell me am I very far? 
Am I very far now
Am I very far now
Am I very far now

1996,32,Not Gon' Cry,Mary J. Blige,R&b,"While all the time that I was loving you 
You were busy loving yourself 
I would stop breathing if you told me to 
Now you're busy loving someone else 
Eleven years out of my life 
Besides the kids I have nothing to show 
Wasted my years a fool of a wife 
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago 

Well I'm not gon cry, 
I'm not gon cry, 
I'm not gon shed no tears 
No, I'm not gon cry, 
it's not the time 
cuz you're not worth my tears

I'm not gon cry, 
I'm not gon shed no tears 
No, I'm not gon cry, 
it's not the time, 
cuz you're not worth my tears 

I was your lover and your secretary 
Working every day of the week 
Was at the job when no one else was there 
Helping you get on your feet 
Eleven years of sacrifice 
And you can leave at the drop of a dime 
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side 
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times 


I know there are no guarantees 
In love you take your chances 
But somehow it seems unfair to me 
Look at the circumstances 
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part 
Those were the words that we said from our hearts 
So now when you say that you're leaving me 
I don't get that part

My mama thinks that my minds gone but i ain't never crossed

Look at the situation, they got me facing
i can,t live a normal life, i was raised by the state
so i gotta be down with the hood team
too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin banger
and my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool! Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
i'm living life, do or die what can i say
I'm twenty-three now , but will i live to see twenty-four
the way things is going i don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
that the ones we hurt are you and me
Power in the money , money in the power
minute after minute, hour after hour
everybodys running but half of them ain't looking
what's going on in the kitchen but I don't know what's cookin'
they say i gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand , how can they reach me? 
i guess they can't , i guess they won't , i guess they front
that's why my life is outta luck fool !

You say, I think I remember the film
And as I recall I think we both kinda like it
And I say, well that's the one thing we got

And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
Somewhat now, it's plain to see we're over
And I hated the bigs are over

1996,41,The World I Know,Collective Soul,,"Has our conscience shown
Has the sweet breeze blown
Has all the kindness gone
Hope still lingers on.
I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why.

Are we listening
To hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see
That love is gathering
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one.

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below.
And I laugh at myself
As the tears roll down.
'Cause it's the world I know.
It's the world I know.

1996,42,No Diggity,Blackstreet,R&b,"
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

No diggity, I try to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
She's managed by the town,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching catichin' vilians is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs 
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride


Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

Cause thats my peeps and we row G
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherf.. thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flava
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

I would do anything, girl, anything for you
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I could hold you tight
Pain in my heart
Because I'm all alone
Why did you leave 
Why did your love have to go
When I would do anything for you, I would
Thinking of ways 
That I can win your heart
But, I'm so confused
I don't know where to start
Visions of love
Forever in my mind
I wait for the day when 
I can say that girl's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you, yes I would
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take 
Because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you go
Girl, I would do anything for you, yes I would
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So, if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, I swear I will do anything
I'll give you love
Oh, I 'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love
Oh, I 'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love
Oh, I 'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love
Oh, I 'll give you love
I would do anything for you
I said I would do, babe
I would do anything for you
I said I would do, babe
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
I said I'd give you love, baby
I'll gve you love
Oh, anything you want my baby
The things you want
Girl, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give it to you
I would do anything for you
I said I would do, babe
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
Anything, girl, anything for you
I'll give you love
I'll give you love
Oh, my
The things you want
I love you, girl, I swear I'll give you love baby
And when you need my love
My girl, I'll give you love

I would do anything for you
I swear I would do, babe
I would do anything for you
Anything you want, baby
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

1996,44,1979,The Smashing Pumpkins,Alternative rock,"Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all
And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin dues down to see
That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope
Justine never knew the rules,
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made, I know you better than you fake it
To see that we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
The street heats the urgency of sound
As you can see there's no one around

1996,45,Diggin' on You,TLC,Pop,"I was like peace in a groove
On a sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bay-ooo-baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gone be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relation-ships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am


Oh why do I feel the way I do
When all I can think about is you
Diggin' diggin' diggin' on you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you
Do you know
Why I'm diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you


Diggin' on you
It's on like that
Diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you

Can you teach me about tommorrow

Running free 
Cause tomorrow's just another day 
And I don't believe in time 
Time, I don't understand 
Children killing in the street 
Dying for the color of red

Just lay me down in sleep

Like a tree growing all alone 
The wind just stripped me bare, stripped me bare

You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tatsted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun , the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful


Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love

There are pieces here I don't know where they go 
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips 
I bet you feel a little crazy but for me 
We'll be famous on t.v. 
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would it be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to tast it 
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it 
I jump on you, you jump on me 
You push me aut and even though you know 
I love you I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth 
When I kiss your salty lips 
You will feel a little crazy 
But for me I'll be famous on t.v. 
Now, will it be my fault 
If I take your love and throw it wide? 
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart 
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole 
And I know where they go

To pull back the door.
To take me by the hand and lead me through.
Now you have opened my heart to everything.

I see the beauty that God has created.

One for the money yes uhh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's
And that's a nono


Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
in the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin, they payin
We stay in layin vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
up in dis industry, Outkast yea dem niggaz they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
...around this bitch


Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin down the strip on vogues


Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
passes gettin thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin wine
We's just chillin, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dick, now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone



Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
that I just came from, some nigga was sayin somethin
talkin bout ""Hey man, you remember me from school"" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got buku of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
to the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them Slim ass cigarettes
from Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue

1996,60,Hook,Blues Traveler,Rock,"Music & Lyrics: John Popper
It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel that I'll convey
Some inner truth of vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks
Because the hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely
There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow
Was that the hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely
Suck it in suck it in suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin
To see
What you're doing to me this MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So desperately I sing to thee
Of love
Sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried well no in fact I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities
To the ground I've found
I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because...
The hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook...
On that you can rely

1996,61,Doin' It,LL Cool J,Hip hop,"

Make it hot... then we drop it
Yeah you know
Make it hot


It's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
I'm gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
So what cha sayin, I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga Mandingo in a sec
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin about
But do you really think that you can work it out
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel





I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down
Damn my lover dig down, you use a rubber
Damn right
You are my lover
All night
The putty good to you  Word to momma
Man tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
Word we ain't goin out like that
All this time you've been telling that you was a Don
I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
Mmm, baby wild, don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl
Nice and wet
We get it To The Break of Dawn, damn you're large
How a big girl like it Daddy

Safe sexin it, flexin it, gettin that affectionate
Chewin it, oohin it, all while we're doin it



Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessee
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggaz ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

1996,62,Fastlove,George Michael,Dance-pop,"looking for some education
made my way into the night
all that bullshit conversation
well baby can't you read the signs

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even want to waste your time
let's just say that maybe
you could help to ease my mind
baby, I ain't Mr. Right

chorus
but if you're looking for fastlove
if that's love in your eyes
it's more than enough
had some bad luck
so fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

what's there to think about baby?

looking for some affirmation
made my way into the night
my friends got their ladies
they're all having babies
but I just want to have some fun

I win't bore you with the details baby
gonna get there in your own sweet time
let's just say that maybe
you could help to ease my mind
baby, I ain't Mr. Right

chorus

what's there to think about baby?
get yourself some lessons in love

in the absence of security
I made my way into the night
stupid cupid keeps on calling me
but I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
I miss my baby, tonight
so why don't we make a little room
in my BMW babe
searching for some peace of mind
I help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing 
the same religion
you really ought to get up now

looking for some affirmation?

1996,63,"Touch Me, Tease Me",Case,R&b,"

The job is flow

Pa Pa just keep me laced up
In the illa Case be,Issac Mizrahi
Fuck around with Dolce Gabanna
Sippin' pure 'Zay with the Ill Na Na
Nigga you fuck around
And how you know you tease and you join
Nigga your royalties and your pawn
So what the deal is
But Foxy Brown met Case, now we laced
Bonnie met Clyde now I'm up in Jamaica breaking all your paper

You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Can't nobody make me feel
The way you're making me feel
And girl you know this love is real

Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
Cuz all my love you can control

I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
Cuz tonight you taste like ice cream

I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away


What
Let me get that Lex nigga
Sex, wetter than aquariums
Flashing, they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with lear jets and coups 
My ones stackin' 
You ain't know that I be mackin'
The extra set of keys
The thirty G's
Them chips, the bellies, had you livin' on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
The fourty room palace
Sippin' cristal-ise

Just a little bit 
And everybody needs a chance 
Once in a while 
Everybody wants to be

Everybody one 
Everybody two 
Everybody free 

Everybody needs to touch 
You know now and then 
And everybody wants a good good friend 
Everybody wants to be

And everybody wants to love 
Who they want to love

1996,68,Just a Girl,No Doubt,Ska punk,"Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed
And it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know
Exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me
To hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, little ol' me
Don't let me out of your sight
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh... I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons
For me to run and hide
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things
That I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl,
I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive
Late at night
I'm just a girl,
Guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare
With their eyes
I'm just a girl,
Take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh... I've had it up to here!
Oh... am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world...
That's all that you'll let me be!

I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb
Makes me worry some
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to
Is making me numb
I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison

Oh... I've had it up to!
Oh... I've had it up to!
Oh... I've had it up to here

1996,69,If Your Girl Only Knew,Aaliyah,Funk,"If your girl only knew That you was dissin' her to talk to me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that he was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry*

And if your girl could only see How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that he was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that he was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

She would probably leave you alone

1996,71,Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First),John Mellencamp,,"In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the hotel Flamingo, wearing black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sin the blues
She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what she's doing with him, she could be
Dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant fingers
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah, I just want to be

I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around your heart
Everyone's lookin?br> But I saw you first
On a moon spattered road in her parrot rebozo
Gypsy Scotty's driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
She whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star

I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around your heart
Everyone's lookin?br> 
In the bone colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin?br> The radio is playin? she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about a girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that

I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right

1996,74,Old Man & Me (When I Get to Heaven),Hootie & the Blowfish,,"Well an old man said to me 
In a voice filled with pain 
Where you going young man 
Said I'm going to fight a war 
Gonna fight for my country 
In some foreign land 
He said ""The sun will never hurt you 
Never harmed anyone 
But you must realize"" 
If you try to stare her down 
She will win in the end 
She will burn your eyes 
She will burn them 

Seen a million places 
Seen a million faces die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get to Heaven 

He said ""Boy I was young once 
Yeah I was tough 
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat 
Hey I could kill the enemy 
I could die on foreign streets 
But I could not vote 
But now you walk by me 
You won't talk to me 
Say this is my fate 
But every time you walk the streets boy 
Most of them you meet 
You see it's you they hate 
It's you... 

Seen a million faces 
Seen a million places die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get to Heaven 
I hope I get there 

Seen a million places 
Seen a million faces die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get there 

See this woman sitting next to me 
She's been there for a long, long time 
And when I fell, she picked me up 
When I cried, she wiped my tears 
I thank god she's mine 
And when I leave this world 
She won't have anything 
But her love for me 
'Cause the man took everything else 
Made me hate myself 
So just let her be boy 
Won't you let her be

1996,75,If It Makes You Happy,Sheryl Crow,Rock,"I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos,
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, o.k. I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, o.k. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home


We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between
Well, o.k. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong

1996,76,As I Lay Me Down,Sophie B. Hawkins,Pop,"It felt like spring time on this February morning 
In the courtyard birds were singing your praise 
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel 
Alright I carried them with me today now 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
I feel so high though I am not above the sorrow 
Heavy hearted 'till you call my name 
And it sounds like church bells or the whistle of a train 
On a summer evening I'll run to meet you barefoot 
Barely breathing 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

It's not too near for me 
Like a flower I need the rain 
Though it's not clear to me 
Every season has its change 
And I will see you 
When the sun comes out again 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
And I will wake up happy 
So I pray

1996,77,"Keep On, Keepin' On",MC Lyte,Hip hop,"B-Boy, where the fuck you at? 
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past. 
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper. 
Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a 
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? 
Surely I can, if you the man. 
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice. 
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang
get it on. 
You're gettin' warm. 
I can feel you getting closer. 
Now baby, down this Mimosa. 
You better believe it's time to give a toast to. 
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played. 
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade. 
All over your body. 
Who's body? 
You're body. 
I can rock a party like nobody. 
Leavin' time to take home the loot. 
Choosy about who I let knock my boots. 
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte. 
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right. 
CHORUS:
Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world. 
Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right,
right... Ah, ah, ah....
Beware of the stare when I step into peace. 
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.
Now who from the chosen shall I choose? 
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes. 
I found me a new nigga this year. 
That know's how to handle this here. 
Now I look forward to goin' home at night. 
Brother does mo right. 
Under the candlelight. 
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that? 
I guess I can. 
Can I, why not? 
If I wanna guess I can. Can I? 
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive. 
Sweet like licorice. 
Sugar for my booga. 
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee. 
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check. 
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat. 
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I procede to  Open up and feed you. 
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be. 
Been I can, I get rid of all company.
CHORUS
Many have tried strict regulation. 
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation. 
Those that didn't perform well. 
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell. 
You're playing with my time. 
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me. 
You better work me. 
While you got the oppurtunity. 
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E. 
Only the strong survive. 
Only the wise excel. 
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly. 
Left all alone try to control me. 
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. 
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. 
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. 
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it. 
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it. 
It's natural. Never be ashamed. 
Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.

You left your light on
You know I'm here

I know you're alone
I watched the car leave
Your lover is gone
Let me in

Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over

I know your friend
You told her about me
She filled you with fear
Some kind of sin
How can you turn
Denying the fire
Lover I burn
Let me in

Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over

I know you're confused
I know that you're shaken
You think we'll be lost
Once we begin
I know you're weak
I know that you want me
Lover don't speak
Let me in

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over

1996,80,Who Do U Love,Deborah Cox,,"Last night I slept alone 
I stayed at home 
For the first time since you've been gone babe 
No friends to understand 
To lend a helping hand 
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known 

You walked so easily 
It still remains a mystery 
Remember what you promised me 
But you went away 
And it's such a shame 
How could you turn your back on me baby 

If you don't really want me 
If you don't really love me 
Then who do you love 
If you don't really need me 
If you don't really love me 
Then who do you love 

I gave you everything 
A man could ever need 
I was there whenever you would call me baby 
But somehow your feelings changed 
You don't act the same 
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all 

You walked so easily 
It still remains a mystery 
Remember what you promised me 
And now the lovin's gone 
Oh where did we go wrong 
How could you turn back on me 


I once was blind but baby now I see, yeah 
That I'm not the one 
Who can fill your every need 
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality 
Now I know, yes I know 
That you're not the one for me, oh baby 

I can't fill your every need 
Now I know 

When the time is right 
And you close your eyes 
And you dream at night 
Who do you love 



When the time is right 
And you close your eyes 
Tell me what you're dreamin' babe 
Who do you love

The one thing missing was you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines

One thing was missing that's you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll sail the waters of many colours
We won't need a compass, love will guide our way

Spring time in Paris feels so good to me

1996,87,No One Else,Total,R&b,"Verse 1:
There you are, looking at me,
Tell me what you want this to be.
It could be everything that your heart desires,
All you got to do is stick around for awhile.
There's so many things that I wanna do,
Take you all around, it's all up to you.
If you take my hand and just follow me,
There's no telling what we could be,
Just you and me.

Chorus:
I don't need no one else but you,
Tell me what you want me to do.
I don't need no one else but you,
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true.

Verse 2:
Could you be all that I need,
Show me what I need to see.
If it's alright with you, tell me now baby,
We can take this all the way just tell me how.
There's so many things that I wanna do,
Take you all around, it's all up to you.
Dare you take my hand, and just follow me,
There's no telling what we can be, just you and me.

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
If you wanna just take your time,
I'll understand, just tell me why.
If it's alright with you, I'll let you lead the way,
No need to wait baby, don't hesitate.

Rap by Da Brat:
For what it's worth I'ma keep bustin', keep puffin', and loving nothin'.
If I die I'ma be high, no tears all of a sudden bluffin'.
Never finger on the lever selling records,
In J. Boogie leather ready to wreck a nigga whenever.
What I need is that scholar that could capitalize my dollar,
Capital size when ya hit it make me wanna holler.
I do run run my mouthpiece with a vengeance,
Start repenting if you didn't in the beginning,
You should hit your knees, and do whatever pleases you,
Long as you pleasing me I'm all you need nigga.
The decoy watch Brat kill and destroy,
You the last one to #!*@ with So So Def and Bad Boy.

Repeat Chorus to fade

Break:
I don't need no one baby, as long as I have you,
You gotta believe me baby, 'cos what I say is true.
I don't need no one baby, you're the only one for me,
I don't need nobody else, baby can't you see?

1996,88,My Boo,Ghost Town DJ's,R&b,"Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer, I've been watching you

1-At night I think of you
  I want to be your lady baby
  If your game is on, give me a call, boo
  If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you

Boy you got all I need from what I see
And boy everynight I am constantly thinking of you

Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a Caddy
Chop it up, with Do or Die
Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a Caddy
Chop it up, with Do or Die
Verse One: Belo
Seven double oh P.M.
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sippin Seagram, chewin on a wheat stem
Touchin on my fo' fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beepin this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe
To the crib
Chorus
Verse Two: AK-47, Belo
Seven deuce five, the ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we runnin up on some ri-vals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself
A to the motherfuckin K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uhh, pass it to the left and umm
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls cuz they thinkin about samplin umm
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well...
Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-C, A-C hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sportin nice cars and fancy clothes
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fuckin with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smokin on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well...
Chorus
Verse Three: Tung Twista
Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
and then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spittin mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
to get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provokin hips
and never gotta tell her many lies
I been lookin in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when outta me gotta be
right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk c'mon suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of dem my fellas on the train
while she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your hoe
tryin ta come up on another G
The broad all up under me tryin ta smother me
Lookin love-ly while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin me with lotion
Comin like an ocean coastin have a cig thinking
me and Do or Die dig drinkin love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the Feds or spittin game but it's chicken and bread
Kickin them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'ma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp type shit that B-Low and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a hoe wanna holler then you a playa if you hit them ends
and get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same hoe to wanna freak your friends
Cause I studied P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
Be learnin these hoes biology, obviously, well...

1996,92,Until It Sleeps,Metallica,Alternative rock,"Until It Sleeps

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run, but it stays right my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once, and now it stays

So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, until I'm clean

Chorus:
It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

Chorus

I don't want it
So tear me open, but beware
The things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, 'till I'm clean...

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the fear still shapes me 
So hold me, until it sleeps...

Until it sleeps...

1996,93,Hay,Crucial Conflict,Midwest hip hop,"Sittin on a quarter 'p of hay
Thangs is feelin good today.
I'm tore up,from the floor up
Sippin on some crown royal.
Trippin,in a circle of wood
Where everybody smoke they own bud.
Good ole' hay
How you feel today
Fine,blowed and dandy.
Silly like i'm hype off candy.
Gotta big,thick chic named sandy.
In the farm in the middle of the barn
Where everybody's feelin crazy.
I went to visit granny's house. 
Now i see why don't nobody leave.
We constantly,constantly,constantly smokin b's.
Too blitzed to even shake it off
But i still got my head up.
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn
And get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut,
Blaze it up so i can hit that bud.
Git me zoned and i'll be on.
Cuz i love to smoke upon hay.

Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.

The hay got me goin through a stage
And i just can't get enough.
Smokin everyday
I got some hay
And you know i'm finna roll it up.
Make a cloud
I'm gonna take my mind away from all the
Bullcrap.
Bump my sounds
Lay back and roll
Mack to the freaks that's on the road.
Sometimes i wonder 
When i was blowed on the streets. 
Anybody wanna step to me,
I'ma see how rough they be.
In this session,manifesting
On myp's and q's
Never snooze cause i refuse.
Inhale,exhale the smell.
Smokin hay all by myself.
Wildstle,laughin loud.
Wit my homies by my side.
If somethin jump off let it ride
On my square when time is live.
Everybody throw it up
Go to the barn and get some hay.
When i get my choke on.
Fool you know i'm smokin on......

Hay now hay
We smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And i'm lit up
Can't get up
My eyes are red
And my head is spinnin.
Took another pull
Ridin red bull
Got the goofies, can't stop grinnin.
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids
And we bout to get in em.
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at
And everything funny.
Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high
Smokin all that hay with no money.
Now truly this bitch wanna do me
So i hit the 151bacardi
She high like the sun 
Thick like cornbread,and i'm ready to party.
That hay got me so gotdamn horny
But i don't like that tramp.
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie
cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps.
And i got the munchies
I need soul food.
Collard greens or pinto beans.
If you smoke hay like the conflict do,
Then you know what the hell i mean.


Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack.
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that
Hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb,
I creeped up on the wall and all i heard.
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in 
The hay
With a funky dime word.
Couldn't be myself
Couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If i didn't pass it to the left.
Nigga would have lost my breath.
Open up the window 'fore i fall and faint
But i can't
Cause i roll around in dat barn ride.
Rollin up the hootie hoo
Roughest skin roller on dat west side.
Nigga come on in
I got some hay
Won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for
Ain't nobody to rich, we poor.
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn
The flies keep us chokin.
Thank you jesus christ
For all the hay you're givin us
Cause we'll keep on smokin'.

I got memories I got shit 
So don't you go show 
Oh I walked the line when you held me in that night

An empty shells seem so easy to crack 
Got all these questions don't know who I could even ask 
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream 
Where I'm not ugly and your lookin' at me 

And I stayed in bed 
Oh in a little while I'll see you 
If just once I could feel love 
Oh I'd say it like I mean it

1997,1,"Candle in the Wind 1997"" / ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight",Elton John,Pop rock,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 

Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
You called out to our country 
And you whispered to those in pain 
Now you belong to heaven 
And the stars spell out your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will 

Loveliness we've lost 
These empty days without your smile 
This torch we'll always carry 
For our nation's golden child 
And even though we try 
The truth brings us to tears 
All our words cannot express 
The joy you brought us through the years 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned our long before 
Your legend ever will 

Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
Goodbye England's rose 
From a country lost without your soul 
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion 
More than you'll ever know 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And you footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will

1997,2,"You Were Meant for Me"" / ""Foolish Games",Jewel,,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
Got my eggs and my pancakes too
Got my maple syrup, everything but you.
Break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
Never put wet towels on the floor anymore' cause
Dreams last so long
even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.
Called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
Picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
Saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.
Go about my business, I'm doin fine
Besides, what would I say if U had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday.
Brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up. Turn the sheets down.
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hot into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it


Hey, cuz I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothign to it

I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly

1997,12,MMMBop,Hanson,Pop rock,"You have so many relationships in this life,
But only one or two will last.
You go through all the pain and strife,
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast.

Oh yeah. They're gone so fast.

Oh, so hold on to the ones who really care,
In the end they'll be the only ones there.
When you get old and start losing your hair,
Can you tell me who will still care?
Can you tell me who will still care? Oh care.

Chorus:

MMMBop, ba duba dop ba do bop,
Ba duba dop ba do bop,
Ba duba dop ba do. Oh yeah,

Oh yeah, in an MMMBop they're gone. Yeah.

I will shield your heart from the rain
I will let no harm come your way
Oh these arms will be your shelter
No these arms won't let you down,
If there is a mountain to move
I will move that mountain for you

For you I will, lay my life on the line
For you I will fight, oooooh
For you I will die
With every breathe, with all my soul
I'll give my world
I'll give it all
And I'll have to leave it be

I will go and bring you the moon
For you I will, I will, I will, I will,

I will be your hero your strength
I will let you wait for all times

Before anything began between us 
You were like my best friend 
The one I used to run and talk to 
When me and my girl was having problems 
You used to say it'll be OK 
Suggest little nice things I should do 
And when I go home at night and lay my head down 
All I seem to think about was you 
And how 

Repeat 1 

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up 
Knowing it should have been you 
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you 
What should I do? 
Should I tell my baby bye-bye? 
Should I do exactly what I feel inside? 
Cuz I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay 
But I really need to get it together 

Repeat 1 

Baby it's kind of honey 
How you make me feel 
I wanna kiss you and hold your hand with your permission 
Honey got me twisted in the head like a cuckoo clock 
Trying not to look 
But I, but I, but I can't stop 
What can I say? I wanna be with you 
Usher bring in the hook, I'm out dude what? 

Repeat 1 

Ooh you're making me 
You're making me, you're make me 
Oh you make me¡­

1997,15,Bitch,Meredith Brooks,Alternative rock,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing


Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me


I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way

When you want me to stop 


I want the night 
For me and you 
So come here baby 
And let me do it to you 

Don't be afraid 
'Cuz I won't bite 
I promise to give it to you 
Just the way you like

1997,18,Barely Breathing,Duncan Sheik,Pop rock,"Barely Breathing 

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear 
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears 
You really had me going, wishing on a star 
But the black holes that surround you are heavies by far 
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn 
Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born 
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide 
You really can't be serious if you have to ask me why 
I say goodbye... 

'Cause I am barely breathing, And I can't find the air 
I don't know who I'm kidding, imaging you care 
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day 
But I don't suppose it's worth the price, worth the price 
The price that I would play 

Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? 
I used to be so certain, and I can't figure out 
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain 
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame 
Will it ever change? 

Chorus

I've come to find, I may never know 
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? 

I rise above, or sink below 
With every time, you come and go 
Please don't come and go 

Chorus
"
1997,21,The Freshmen,The Verve Pipe,Alternative rock,"When I was young I knew everything 
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice 
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor 
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice 

I can't be held responsible 
Cause she was touching her face 
I won't be held responsible 
She fell in love in the first place 

For the life of me I cannot remember 
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise 
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins 
We were merely freshmen 

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her 
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept 
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor 
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says 

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this 
We never talk of our lacking relationships 
And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor 
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say
"
1997,22,I Want You,Savage Garden,Synth-pop,"Anytime I need to see your face, 
I just close my eyes 
And I am taken to a place where 
your crystal mind and 
Magenta feelings take up shelter 
in the base of my spine 
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola 
I don't need to try and explain; 
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again, I might move 
so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face 
of the human cannonball 
That I need to, I want to 

Come stand a little bit closer 
Breath in and get a bit higher 
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you 


Ooh, I want you 
I don't know if I need you 
But, ooh, I'd die to find out 
Ooh, I want you 
I don't know if I need you 
But, ooh, I'd die to find out 

I'm the kind of person who endorses 
a deep commitment 
Getting comfy getting perfect 
is what I live for 
But a look, then a smell of perfume 
It's like I'm down on the floor 
And I don't know what I'm in for  

Conversation has a time and place 
In the interaction of a lover and 
a mate, 
But the time of talking, 
using symbols, using words 
Can be likened to a deep sea diver 
who is swimming with a raincoat 

Come stand a little bit closer 
Breathe in and get a bit higher 
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you 


Anytime I need to see your face, 
I just close my eyes 
And I am taken to a place where 
your crystal mind and 
Magenta feelings take up shelter 
in the base of my spine 
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola 

I don't need to try and explain; 
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again, I might move 
so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face 
of the human cannonball 
That I need to, I want to 


So can we find out

1997,23,No Diggity,Blackstreet,R&b,"
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

No diggity, I try to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
She's managed by the town,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching catichin' vilians is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs 
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride


Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

Cause thats my peeps and we row G
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherf.. thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flava
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

1997,26,Every Time I Close My Eyes,Babyface,R&b,"Girl, it's been a long, long time comin'
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true
That someone like you
Loves me too

Girl, I think that you're truly somethin'
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true
With you baby, it never rains and it's no wonder
The sun always shines when I'm near you
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you

I've cried myself to sleep
You really oughtta know
How much you mean to me
It's only right that you be in my life right here with me

Ha, I'ma make you dance
You wanna move
Ha, I'ma make you move
Dru Hill come on

I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong

Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
Sleepin' in bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name


What else did you want
What else did you need
Giving you everything plus my heart
But you still ran out on me

Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many

My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family

Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn

Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit

I make em sick cause I'm the williest

Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch

Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal

Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers

We make believers out of dreamers

If you got what I need I can gurarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you'll always be around
Do you know what it takes to love me
Do you know what it takes to do me right
Do you know what it takes to love me baby

Heaven knows in my time I've been lonely
Feelin' my love echo in my mind, in my mind yeah
A never satisfied girl's what they call me
But I just can't keep goin' on livin' lies

Guarantee unto me, you won't let me down
There's so much I can give but it's buried so deep
I just got to be sure that you always will be around

do you know what it takes

You got to prove that you will always be around
I'll give you everything

Will you do anything

1997,30,4 Seasons of Loneliness,Boyz II Men,,"I love for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try
When I get the courage up to love
somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just
can't compare to you
Your love won't release me I'm bound
under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as i watch 4
season's change
Chorus:
In come the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the
mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of
your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we
used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the
trees are bare
When  you're not here it doesn't feel
  the same
Remember the nights when we closed
our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be
in love for all time
Anytime I think about these things I
shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so
emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under
ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4
season's change

This loneliness
has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'cause I need your love to comfort me
and ease my pain
Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness
again

Honey you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there

Far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me

And I'm dying for you cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'

To leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing
I wanna do

And you took the job in tennessee 
You made friends at the farm 
And you joined them at the bar 
Almost every single day of the week

I will wash the dishes while you go have a beer 
Where is my Marlboro man 
Where is his shiny gun 
Where is my lonely ranger 
Where have all the cowboys gone

1997,39,Sunny Came Home,Shawn Colvin,Folk rock,"by Shawn Colvin   John Leventhal 
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission


She says days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire


Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said 
Sunny came home with a vengeance


She says days go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire


Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it


Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright
Sunny came home
Sunny came home...

Emotional touch, touchin' my skin
And asking you to do what you've been doin' all over again

1997,42,Mouth,Merril Bainbridge,,"I feel like I've been blown apart.
There are pieces here I don't know where they go 
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips 
I bet you feel a little crazy but for me 
We'll be famous on t.v. 
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would it be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to tast it 
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it 
I jump on you, you jump on me 
You push me aut and even though you know 
I love you I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth 
When I kiss your salty lips 
You will feel a little crazy 
But for me I'll be famous on t.v. 
Now, will it be my fault 
If I take your love and throw it wide? 
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart 
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole 
And I know where they go

1997,43,All Cried Out,Allure,Pop,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, falling 
Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you...
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple  Hello 
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure 
My heart never knew such pain
Now I'm all cried out, over you

ooh
Cryin' over you, yeah

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?

Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance of these flames
Why should I take the blame?
Apology not accepted
At me to the broken hearts you've collected
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
Over you

I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you

You left me so confused

Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

so sorry baby, please forgive me
please forgive me

1997,45,Invisible Man,98 Degrees,Pop,"You can hardly
wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine
And how he always
makes your heart skip a beat
Every time he walks by
And if you're feeling down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when
you're makin' love
He's everything
you've been dreaming of
Oh baby

I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes
lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than
any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man

You probably spend
hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all
It doesn't matter
what the conversation
Just as long as he called
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
You wipe away each other's tears
Your face lights up
whenever he appears

I see you all the time baby
The way you look at him
I wish it was me sweetheart
Boy I wish it was me
But I guess I'll never be...

"
1997,46,Not Tonight,Lil' Kim,Hip hop,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the henny rimmy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep,I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's scremain ""Gimme,""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue U
Had a weedspot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I aint frontin'
The sex was wack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I aint beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin.""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double plat
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'


The moral of the story is this
You aint lickin' this, you aint stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They aint hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I aint with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I aint gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me

How you feel.

You know I don't wanna go,

1997,49,All by Myself,Celine Dion,Soft rock,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself

Don't wanna live

1997,50,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,Celine Dion,Soft rock,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
Al coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

And when you kiss me like this
And when I touch you like that
If you do it like this
And if we...

It started over coffee 
We started out as friends 
It's funny how from simple things 
The best things begin.

This time it's different 
And it's all because of you 
It's better than it's ever been

 quot;Can I call you sometimes quot; 
It's all you had to say 
To take my breath away.

This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night

My life has just begun 
I finally found someone.

Did I keep you waiting 

Barbra Streisand:
I didn't mind 

Bryan Adams:
I apologize.

I would wait forever just to know 
You were mine. 
You know, I love your hair 
Are you sure it looks right 
I love what you wear 
Isn't it too tight 
You're exceptional 
Can't wait for the rest of my life.

And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, o.k. I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, o.k. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home


We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between
Well, o.k. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong

Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house
Chorus:
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Verse One:
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred, I'm a veteran
which means that I've been in the game too long
Since the days of Paper Thin way back when I've been putting it
down ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of
the M I C, I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request, You like the rhyme
Bite if you dare, I get the paper so I don't care, Fly that's me
The epitomy of what a real MC is supposed to be, Fucking you up
everytime that I drop, Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well and if you take a look
it ain't hard to tell that I
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
it's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from but I'm resting in Studio City
and don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best, West to East
See East to West, ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.  Cause it's crazy how I
get you captured with my tactics, I got many witnesses
that can back this ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
make the ill type moves, I guide the best and ride it well
and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Get out my shit, Please let me be, I don't see why -- you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that, Trying to get over
like a fat rat, but I understand -- I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop, it goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver, chillin with
a pina colada, kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I gotta
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why!  5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, What they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew, Cause I ride the beat
and I ride it well and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
To the L, to the Y, and the T, to the E
Rock the house and rock the house

1997,63,Building a Mystery,Sarah McLachlan,,"you come out at night
that's when the energy comes
and the dark side's light
and the vampires roam 
you strut your rasta wear 
and your suicide poem
and a cross from a faith
that died before Jesus came
you're building a mystery

you live in a church
where you sleep with voodoo dolls
and you won't give up the search
for the ghosts in the halls
you wear sandals in the snow
and a smile that won't wash away
can you look out the window
without your shadow getting in the way
oh you're so beautiful
with an edge and a charm
but so careful 
when I'm in your arms

'cause you're working
building a mystery
holding on and holding it in
yeah you're working
building a mystery
and choosing so carefully

you woke up screaming aloud
a prayer from your secret god
you feed off our fears
and hold back your tears

give us a tantrum 
and a know it all grin
just when we need one
when the evening's thin

oh you're a beautiful
a beautiful fucked up man
you're setting up your 
razor wire shrine

1997,64,I Love You Always Forever,Donna Lewis,Pop,"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rain come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stilness, soft spoken words
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say you'll love and love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
"
1997,65,Your Woman,White Town,Alternative pop,"Just tell me what you've got to say to me,
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth,
It comes as no surprise at all you see,
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through!

Now I know your heart, i know your mind,
You don't even know you've been unkind,
So much for all your high bread boxes waste,
Just use me up and then you walk away.
Oh you can't play me that way!

Well I guess what you say is true -
I could never be the right kind of girl for you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!

When I saw my best friend yesterday,
She said she never liked you from the start,
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same,
But you always knew you held my heart!

You're such a charming, handsome man,
Now I think I finally understand!
Is it in your jeans? I don't know!
But I'll stay for hours -- that's for sure!
Why did you play me this way?

Well I guess what you say is true -
I could never be the right kind of girl for you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!

Well I guess what they say is true -
I could never spend my life with a man like you!

I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!
I could never be your woman...
I could never be your woman!

1997,66,C U When U Get There,Coolio,,"Verse 1: Coolio 
Now I've seen places and faces 
and things you ain't never thought about thinking 
if you ain't peek then you must be drinking 
and smokin' 
pretending not to locin' but you're brokin' 
let me get you open 
now little Timmy got his diploma and 
little Jimmy got life 
and Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe 
the other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money 
and when the other homies heard about it they thought that it wasfunny 
but who's the dummy 
Cuz, now you done lost the hustler 
a down-ass brother got replaced by a buster 
and though I got love for ya 
I know I can't trust ya 
coz my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dustas 
and just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more 
I guess that's just the way it goes 
I ain't tryina preach 
I believe I can reach 
but your mind ain't prepared 
I'll C U when you get there 
Chorus: 
I'll see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
I'll see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
More temptation and faith 
I guess we livin' for the day 
I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK 
the situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted 
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business 
coz it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention 
so you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin' 
life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse 
someone's gotta run a little faster cuz we gotta lay the struggle 
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender 
and if everybody's a sinner then everybody could ba a winner 
no matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers 
and regardless of the time somebody up there still love us 
I'm a scuff and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak 
I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak 
always keep reaching sure to grab on to something 
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin' 
Chorus: 
I'll see you when you get there 
see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
I'll see you when you get there 
see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
You need to loosen up 
and live a little 
and if you got kids let them know how you feelin' 
for your own sake give a little 
oh, you don't want to hear that 
you busy tryina stack 
and keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own 
the realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest 
but some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone 
could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us 
we prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when 
it's something wrong and we desire 
so hold your head up high if your poor and righteous 
I know time seems right 
and the problems seem endless 
but at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together 
and if you fell you're out the game then you need to get back in it 
coz nothing worse than a quitter 
you gotta face responsibility one day, my brother 
so gather up your pitty and turn it to ambition 
and put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side 
Chorus: 
I'll see you when you get there 
see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
when you ever get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
I'll see you when you get there 
see you when you get there 
if you ever get there 
if you ever get there 
see you when you get there 
As we walk down the road of our destiny 
and the time comes to choose which it gonna be 
the wide and crooked, on a straight barrel 
we got one push to give and one life to live 
stand up for something or lie down in your game 
listen to the song that we sing 
it's up to you to make it big 
I guess I'll see you when you see me

1997,67,Change the World,Eric Clapton,Country,"If I can reach the stars,
Pull one down for you,
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth:

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems.
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams.

And I can change the world,
I will be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.

And if I could be king,
Even for a day,
I'd take you as my queen;
I'd have it no other way.

And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made.
Till then I'd be a fool,
Wishing for the day...

That I can change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

I could change the world,
I would be the sunlight in your universe.
You would think my love was really something good,
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.
Baby if I could change the world.

summertime and just talk about just making it 
You know what I'm saying being successful

I believe that's every kids dream 
you know what I'm saying to rise and 
be somebody but damn! 
Sometimes we just get caught up 


I ain't got no money 
And I ain't got no friends 
Looks like my world is coming to an end 
No food on the table, no clothes on my back 
No shoes on my feet and

Gotta feed babygirl who would die

1997,71,Last Night,Az Yet,R&b,"Last night you were so in to in
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tatsted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun , the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful


Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love

1997,74,What About Us,Total,R&b,"I like the way its goin' down,
I ain't done a remix in a long time.
I like to make it hot,
I like to make it real hot, Black Rob.

Rap by Black Rob:
Hey yo, who dat comin' through my block like that,
Oh, nobody but that Bad Boy cat.
What's his name, Black Rob, y'all heard dukes was famous,
Money talks, Puffy joints with Total is hot.
The latest was bangin' in the club like oh my God,
I be wishin' that them honeys come through my hood.
Take a different approach, just play, respect the coach,
That's Black, and since I'm rollin' with Total that's that.

Verse One:
Baby, I seen you with another lady,
I just finished having your baby,
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me?
Baby, you know I'm about to be swazy,
I can't stand my lover being shady,
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me?

Chorus:
What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What we gon' do?
Total help me sing, Total help me sing.
What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What we gon' do?

Verse Two:
Baby, I know that you've been pimpin',
Mister baller, trickin',
Why you have to go, go and leave me?
Baby, I always been your baby,
Love make a girl go crazy,
I can't understand why you left me...uum-hmm.

Repeat Chorus

Break:
I remember we used to spend countless nights,
We were the best of friends.
Our love could have been one that never ends,
Whatever happened to us?

Rap by Black Rob:
Hey yo, what about you, what about me,
I'm tryin' to get dough nothing comes for free.
And I know you like the way Black play and parlay...
...or I ain't gon' spit one verse.
Y'all don't want me to rise, go into first,
Rather see me face down in the back of a hearse.
Well I refuse to lose till I'm battered and bruised,
Still managed to get my grill on the six o'clock news...
...Spittin' false information I know gon' lead exact to your camp
Black Rob heavyweight champ,
When I strike I'ma leave behind the Bad Boy stamp.

Repeat Chorus to fade
"
1997,75,Smile,Scarface,Hip hop,"

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
that's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
through all the rain and the pain,
you gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah.


Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
or the repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now




Now as I open up my story
with the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile



Fuck the world as we  and witness furious speeds
of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga


And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace 
may the angels help to lead the way
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac
Smile

Oh, that blows my mind

Strawberries I'm thinking 
Or some honey for your toes

1997,77,Secret Garden,Bruce Springsteen,Soft rock,"She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get

To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away

Heh, heheheh

I got, no time for fake niggaz
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggaz



Yeauhhh, I Momma, Miss Ivana
Usually rock the Prada, sometimes Gabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches
Puff Daddy pump the Hummer for the summer
I follow -- in the E-Class with the goggles
96 models, Bad Click on the stroll
Nuttin make a woman feel betta
than Berrettas and Amarettas, butta leathers and mad cheddaz
Chillin in a Benz with my ami-gos
Tryin to stick a nigga for his pe-sos
If you say so's, then I'm the same chick
that you wanna get with, lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot, if not don't test the poom poom
nanny nanny, punanny donny, heyyy!


And while you niggaz talk shit we count bank figures


How you like it baby  Uhh, from the front
Uhh, from the back, give that ass a smack
Bet your man won't do it like that
Can't work the middle, plus his thing too little
Let me grab your ta-ta's, do the cha-cha
Work down your ta-ta's do the cha-cha
Make you scream Pa-pa

You da best, Da Da
Now watch mama, go up and down dick to jaw crazy
Before you nut, I'ma dribble down your butt cheeks
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a little
I'm drinkin babies, then I cracks for the Mercedes
Act shady, and feel my three-eighty *gun cocks*
or the raven, oohwee I see
Your girl ain't a ""Freak Like Me"", or Adina



Diggin in your stash
no licky licky -- fuck the dicky dicky
and the quickie, gimme your loot
Your Mac-11 then shoot
Your game ain't sweet, John Paul peeps
shouldn't compete, if you can't wet it, forget it
Don't sweat it, I bet it'd
make ya cum smooth if you let it
Huh, you can't stop a bitch from ballin
Ha-ha to la-la to drive-by's they be callin, and you ain't know
I stay draped in diamonds and pearls
Beside every man is a Bad Girl

Spread love, c'mon
As we proceed, to give you what you need!
We continue on!
Uh-uh, uh-uh, c'mon!
Hahah

1997,81,Naked Eye,Luscious Jackson,,"wearing nothing is divine
naked is a state of mind
i take things off to clear my head
to say the things i haven't said
i live inside the elements
the earth and sky are my best friends
water is the evidence
that washes me from end to end

with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if i said it all
i could see

it's not a choice i tried to make
it's not a thought i couldn't take
something told me it was time
to give you yours and leave me mine
my vision started to be clear
i watched the sunlight coming near
i knew the day i knew the night
i knew i could regain my sight


last night i came into your home
to break some ice and throw some stones
i asked if we could be alone
i had some troubles of my own
knew i had to say goodbye
to all the old things held inside
if i let the moment fly
i knew they'd all be magnified


came around after dark
you are nothing but a lark
know i snuck in like a narc
i knew i had to leave my mark
wanted to be satisfied
i tried to be dignified
wearing nothing is divine
naked is a state of mind

On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say wait a minute, Queen
What's your name
I be that gypsy
Flippin' life game from the right brain
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a super nova star
She be the light
When they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
Across up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well well I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men

2 fish, 1 swimmin' up stream
1 swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melinated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this earth
What'

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Bridge!
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal

Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material

Cause you did not do your math
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Mad props to god ja born

Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beat the bring us
But that's all I have ain't got no mo
But still the people really wanna to know

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it aint nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools 
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in



They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats

then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in



I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
cuz I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

Can't sit out the gig playing 2.8 

Real studded jewel funded 

Got to love it 

First rap cat with the R&B budget 

Every day on the TV me and PD 

Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD 

Why y'all forever roudy 

I be out here somewhere in Maui 

Till I go back to Cali 


Can't understand how he can treat you the that way he does 

Give me the chance to show you baby, your better off with me 


I wanna make you smile) 

I wanna love you like you need to be loved

And you should be mine 


Don't waste your time

Insecure feel funny 

I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money 

Plus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways 

But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays 

When you shopping did you shop for 2 

Uh! 

Take you where the waters aqua blue 

Let you fall back 

Treat you like you're all that 

Under umbrellas with your shades and straw hat 

You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night 

Just to save a fight 

Or say he's right 

And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life 

Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife 

How a man deserve you if he hurt you 

Then he give a woman 25 a curfew 

Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me 

Cuz Mase ain't the player with the PhD 


Girl come into my world 

I love you the way that you need to be loved 

No worries, no more 

Girl open the door 

And don't waste your time 

Cuz you should be mine 





He don't love you right

1997,89,Go the Distance,Michael Bolton,Show tune,"I have often dreamed, of a far off place 
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me 
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face 
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be 

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance 
I will find my way, if I can be strong 
I know ev'ry mile, will be worth my while 
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong 

Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate 
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you 
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait 
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through 

And I won't look back, I can go the distance 
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat 
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope 
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete 

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part 
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart 

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance 
I will search the world, I will face its' harms 
I don't care how far, I can go the distance 
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms 

I will search the world, I will face its harms 
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms

Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive,
As we used to do?

Bridge:

Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

Chorus:

You must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed


You must love me

That his love is all in me

Wanna change something that's so good 
Because my love is all it took 


Keep on acting like a fool 
You need to know it's me not you 
And if you didn't know it girl it's true 

And try to understand why 
He is a part of my life 
I know it's killing you inside 

What we have you can't take 
From the truth you can't escape 
I can tell the real from the fake 

You're the past, I'm the future 
Get away it's my time to shine 
And if you didn't know the boy is mine 


You're silly games I won't allow 
The boy is mine without a doubt 
You might as well throw in the towel 

When I'm the one that brought him to 
This special place in my heart 
Cause he was my love right from from the start

1998,8,"Candle in the Wind 1997"" / ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight",Elton John,Pop rock,"Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 

Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
You called out to our country 
And you whispered to those in pain 
Now you belong to heaven 
And the stars spell out your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will 

Loveliness we've lost 
These empty days without your smile 
This torch we'll always carry 
For our nation's golden child 
And even though we try 
The truth brings us to tears 
All our words cannot express 
The joy you brought us through the years 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And your footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned our long before 
Your legend ever will 

Goodbye England's rose 
May you ever grow in our hearts 
You were the grace that placed itself 
Where lives were torn apart 
Goodbye England's rose 
From a country lost without your soul 
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion 
More than you'll ever know 

And it seems to me you lived your life 
Like a candle in the wind 
Never fading with the sunset 
When the rain set in 
And you footsteps will always fall here 
Along England's greenest hills 
Your candle's burned out long before 
Your legend ever will

Twista, the first age
Yeah
So come on playa get your lick when its warm
Pull up in front of your crib now
Peep the shine on the chrome
Step out into the breeze and knees up to the back
And you got it now
Let's bump and grind till we moan
Look Shaheed ain't trying to hurt you
Slowly I got to work you
I just want to make you feel real good
Let the words rise stiff
Bumping feels good
Swaying with the smooth beat
On my candy coated cane

It's seven o'clock on the dot
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places I've never seen

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
Where there ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow

See I been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up
Baby, I just wanna take it nice and slow

Ready Now you gotta do me nice and slow
And have you roll on the go
I promise not to be a pest
And kiss ya places another love would've never thought to go
I didn't lose my mind
So I won't be bogus notice how I move to the South
Check this groove cause I'm down
Got you moving and swaying
When we finish we can take a cruise through the town
While my Usher cd is on, check it out

Girl, you got me saying my, my, my
I wish that I could pull over
I don't think they heard me
So call out my name
They call me U-S-H-E-R R-A-Y-M-O-N-D
Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me
Gotta nigga feenin' like Jodeci
Every time that you role with me, holding me
Trying to get control of me
Nice and slowly, you know, never lettin' go
Never messin' up the flow

Cuz I'll freak you right I will

1998,11,How's It Going to Be,Third Eye Blind,Alternative rock,"I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore 
Before you take a swing 
I wonder what are we fighting for 
When I say out loud 
I want to get out of this 
I wonder is there anything 
I'm going to miss 
I wonder how it's going to be 
When you don't know me 
How's it going to be 
When you're sure I'm not there 
How's it going to be 
When there's no one there to talk to 
Between you and me 
Cause I don't care 
How's it going to be, How's it going to be 
Where we used to laugh 
There's a shouting match 
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch 
A silence I can't ignore 
Like the hammock by the 
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty 
Don't see lightning like last fall 
When it was always about to hit me 
I wonder how's it going to be 
When it goes down 
How's it going to be 
When you're not around 
How's it going to be 
When you found out there was nothing 
Between you and me 
Cause I don't care 
How's it going to be 
And how's it going to be 
When you don't know me anymore 
And how's it going to be 
Want to get myself back in again 
The soft dive of oblivion 
I want to taste the salt of your skin 
The soft dive of oblivion oblivion 
How's it going to be 
When you don't know me anymore 
How's it going to be, How's it going to be 
How's it going to be

I see you, I feel you, 
That is how I know you go on 

Far across the distance 
And spaces between us 
You have come to show you go on 

Near, far, wherever you are 
I believe that the heart does go on 
Once more you open the door 
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on 

Love can touch us one time 
And last for a lifetime 
And never let go till we're one 

Love was when I loved you 
One true time I hold to 
In my life we'll always go on 

Near, far, wherever you are 
I believe that the heart does go on 
Once more you open the door 
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on 

There is some love that will not go away 

You're here, there's nothing I fear, 
And I know that my heart will go on 
We'll stay forever this way 
You are safe in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on

Before anything began between us 
You were like my best friend 
The one I used to run and talk to 
When me and my girl was having problems 
You used to say it'll be OK 
Suggest little nice things I should do 
And when I go home at night and lay my head down 
All I seem to think about was you 
And how 

Repeat 1 

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up 
Knowing it should have been you 
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you 
What should I do? 
Should I tell my baby bye-bye? 
Should I do exactly what I feel inside? 
Cuz I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay 
But I really need to get it together 

Repeat 1 

Baby it's kind of honey 
How you make me feel 
I wanna kiss you and hold your hand with your permission 
Honey got me twisted in the head like a cuckoo clock 
Trying not to look 
But I, but I, but I can't stop 
What can I say? I wanna be with you 
Usher bring in the hook, I'm out dude what? 

Repeat 1 

Ooh you're making me 
You're making me, you're make me 
Oh you make me¡­

Without you by my side

Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star

Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't want to say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong, for feeling this way
Especially the thought of givin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night I had to decide, I was thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

We were chillin' watching your T.V.
I felt it was comin' the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And some how in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we're carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting to late, I'm thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right

Ride with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay, so I look both ways
Cop says okay, my tint smoke gray
No way, people leave without handin' me my chips
Got plans to get my land and my 6
People outta town'll understand these hits

Some be wanna bag me, girls be one to stab me
I be more than gladly to tell a foe
Yo, you ain't offendin' me
It ain't like you the third son of the Kennedy
Or even in a mob where you can send for me
But all until you talk you don't ever spend a G

You know me from before when I used to detour
Down in B-more, push the E or

does it matter

but I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
a friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
and show you all the beauty you possess
if you'd only let yourself believe that
we are born innocent
believe me Adia, we are still innocent
it's easy, we all falter, does it matter
believe me Adia, we are still innocent
'cause we are born innocent
Adia we are still
it's easy, we all falter ... but does it matter

You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Chorus:

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open


If I could melt your heart

1998,36,Deja Vu (Uptown Baby),Lord Tariq,East coast hip hop,"New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my fa-mi-ly roam
Hoe damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat...
... splat, like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
and beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex
cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
and I lounge on Lex', and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul 
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, ho
New York niggaz got crazy game
But outta town niggaz is all the same
Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggaz know how to play
Mack the 600, gettin crazy pay
Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the glock, runnin up in yo' spot
But if it wasn't for the Bronx
this rap shit probably never would be going on
so tell me where you from?
PG:	Uptown baby, uptown baby
PG:	We gets down baby, up for the crown baby
Yo, the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
thinking shit's gravy; stop me?  Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
on them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Ri-carro, two quarters of my life
walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharoahe, bought a new five
with the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggaz keep they own shadow
and I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggaz rock gravel
Talk shit?  Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From, Dusk Til Dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
cause youse a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

Or did I not give enough affection 
Not only will your answers keep me sane

Sittin here with my tears
All alone with my fears
I'm wonderin if I have to do
Withoutcha
But there's no reason why

I feel asleep late last night
Cryin like a newborn child
Holdin myself close
Pretendin my arms are yours
I want no one but you


I still remember to the day
In fact is was a 3rd Monday
You came along to be the one for me
Now I'm alone

Sittin here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I'll have the chance
To beg you to stay
I want no one but you


Gonna break it down
Break it down, break it down
Gotta break it down
Break it down, break it down
Whoa

You know
That I know
That I get so lonely thinking of you
Oh-hooh
Noowhoahooo. . .

And you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way 
Have no fear when your tears are fallin' 
I will hear your spirit callin' 
And I swear I'll be there come what may 


'Cause even if we can't be together 
We'll be friends now and forever 
And I swear that I'll be there come what may

1998,51,One Week,Barenaked Ladies,Alternative rock,"One Week 
Words   Music by Ed Robertson 

It's been one week since you looked at me 
cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry. 
Five days since you laughed at me 
saying get that together come back and see me. 
Three days since the living room 
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you 
Yesterday you'd forgiven me 
but it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry 

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink 
As I make you stop, think 
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman 
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss 
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan 
Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes 
Big like Leann Rimes 
Because I'm all about value 
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits 
You try to match wits 
You try to hold me but I bust through 
Gonna make a break and take a fake 
I'd like a stinkin achin shake 
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours 
Gotta see the show, cause then you'll know 
The vertigo is gonna grow 
Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver 

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad 
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad 
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral 
Can't understand what I mean? 
Well, you soon will 
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve 
I have a history of taking off my shirt 

It's been one week since you looked at me 
Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy 
Five days since you tackled me 
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees 
It's been three days since the afternoon 
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon 
Yesterday you'd forgiven me 
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry 

Chickity China the Chinese chicken 
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin' 
Watchin X-Files with no lights on, we're dans la maison 
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one 
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting Frantic 
Like Sting I'm Tantric 
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy 
Like Kurasawa I make mad films 
Okay I don't make films 
But if I did they'd have a samurai 
Gonna get a set of better clubs 
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my 
irons aren't always flying off the back-swing 
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon 
Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes 
that make me think the wrong thing 

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad 
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad 
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral 
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will 
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve 
I have a history of losing my shirt 

It's been one week since you looked at me 
Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry 
Five days since I laughed at you 
and said You just did just what I thought you were gonna do 
Three days since the living room 
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do? 
Yesterday you just smiled at me 
Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry 
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry 
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

I can't make you stay.
I can only let you know I love you any way.
And if the road you take leads to heartbreak,
Somewhere down the line.
If someone ever hurts you,
Or treats your heart unkind...

You just run to the arms of the one who loves you.
You just run to these arms,
And these two arms will keep you warm.
When rain has found your heart,
Never fear, I'm never far.
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you.

I want you happy,
I want the best for you.
And if you have to leave to find your dream,
I hope that dream comes true.
But if the world you find brings you hard times,
If someone makes you cry,
I'll be there to hold you,
I'll be standing by.


My love is strong enough, you know,
Strong enough to let you go.
But I'll always hold you,
Inside my heart.
And if you should ever change your mind,
You can come back any time,
And when you do...

Thought I wanted to fall 
Mean the hummer so stunnin' 
That my bod was tense 
And I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince 
Then I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6 
With Tatyana Ali playin' 
I heard Steely Dan ""Black Cow"" and went wild 
You tell me how can I get down 
That's when they threw me on the redeye to LA

And hit Shaq on the cellay 
Courtside seats so close that we could touch

Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see
Through your eyes
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes
I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes
And there are some things we don't know
Sometimes a heart just needs to go
And there is so much I'll remember
Underneath the open sky with you forever

Me, Lex and Q, we used roll up and jancin over
Now the stretched Testarosa, got an extra sofa
You were always there, had my back
Even before I was the first Latin rapper
To come home with a platinum plaque
I regret her and you pack cuz I want you back
Show a thug some love, baby holler back
Biatch

From demos to limos, N J 900 to Timbo's
You stay by my side 
You're so important in my life

I still love you, babe 
Cuz without you there's no me
I'm still for you, girl
Even though we disagree sometimes
I'll never leave you baby
Cuz I realize I need you in my life

TS, Next

And every moment that I rise
I don't ever wanna say ""Good Bye""
When in my grave my body lies
I still love you

When you get mad, bus pass for laughs
High rise to plush, this is all we had
From government askin', to government taxin'
Credit Forget it
To credit maxin', now we laughin'


My material girl in this material world
I've been givin you pearls since you were just a little girl
Shirley Temple, you look so pretty wit yo little dimples
You know your shitty 'mental got u ready to flip your nipples
Why you pierce your nipples To feel a little independent
I'm glad you did it, hunny, the money's there
Go head and spend it, you represen'ed since the beginning
So if I cheat on you with other women
I promise to hit da box in 'em


Big Pun, Big Pun, baby
Uh, make it hurt, baby
Make it hurt, baby
Uh, what, uh
Uh, uh, uh 
No doubt
Bring it home
Bring it home baby
Uh
Every time girl
Every time girl
Uh, nice tonight
I make it hurt baby
I make it hurt baby
Big Pun, baby
No doubt

Dans la chaleur de la nuit qui s'enroule tout autour de moi
Je marche seule sans savoir pourquoi tu n'es plus la
Ca tourne dans ma tete
Et tout s'arrete
Ta voix me parle tout bas

Tu n'es qu'un reve qui s'enfuit
It's a cruel, cruel summer

1998,68,Victory,Puff Daddy,East coast hip hop,"Intro: Notorious B.I.G. 

One, one two 
Check me out right here yo 

Verse One: Puff Daddy 

Yo, the sun don't shine forever 
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together 
Better now than never, business before pleasure 
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better? 
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight 
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right 
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin 
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin? 
You know that I'm two levels above you baby 
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby 
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked 
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke 
So the only thing left now is God for these cats 
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats 
I'ma win cause I'm too smart for these cats 

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. 

In The Commision, you ask for permission to hit em 
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em 
You heard of us, the murderers, most shady 
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me 
The son of *Satan*, they say my killin's too blatant 
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin 
Duct tapin, your fam destiny 
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist 
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal 
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal 
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars 
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes 
Excellence is my presence, never tense 
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick 
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike 
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson 
action, pack guns, ridiculous 
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch 
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch 
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso 
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows 
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit 
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes 
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone 
Hold hands and say it like me 
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic 
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic 
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit 
See me, only me 
The Underboss of this holocaust 
Truly yours, Frank White 

Chorus: Busta Rhymes 

We got the real live shit from front to back 
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at? 
Where the fuck my bitches at? 
Where my bitches is at? 

Verse Three: Puff Daddy 

Put your money on the table and get your math on 
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on 
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on 
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on 
I never lose the passion to go platinum 
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone 
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it 
to make classics, hotter than acid 
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD 
The girl-boy killa, no team illa 
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel 
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle 
What you can do is check your distribution 
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em 
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad 
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be 

Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G. 

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights 
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two midas 
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us 
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity 
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook' 
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect 
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish 
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish 
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe 
Break bread, with the Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch 
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him 
Niggaz step up, with just Mase and 'em 
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused 
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy 
Business wise, I play men 
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men 
You screamin, I position, competition 
Nother day in the life of the Comission 

Chorus 2X w/ Puff talking 
	Aiyyo, can you hear me out there? 
	Aiyyo turn me up, nobody can hear me out there 
	That's good, it's all fucked up now 
	Y'all know it's all fucked up now right? 
	What the fuck I'ma do now? 
	What I'ma do now? 
	Can y'all hear me out there? 
	Can y'all hear me out there? 


	It's all fucked up now 
	What I'ma do now, huh? 
	What I'ma do now 
	It's all fucked up now
"
1998,69,Too Much,Spice Girls,Pop,"Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless, words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end
But short term solution aint no resolution
There aint no release for me

Too much of something is bad enough
Too much of nothing is just as tough

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Somethin' fine built to last
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast

There's no complication there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me


What part of no don't you understand
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can

Boy who thinks he can

Too much of something is bad enough
Too much of nothing is just as tough


Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie

We grind ya'll
Bounce back, open your mind ya'll
Grind your whole ass till you twist your waistline

Hey yo feel the base line
Stack the overdrive
Bounce, baby feel the incline
So geniune, everytime, Busta redefine
The wicked knew the dime
Makin ya'll press rewind
Hope you feelin fine
Watch me combine and intertwine
The bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine
On all kinds of little swine
Stick the worst of porcupine
If you tryin to take mine
Yo, pick up my nigga Splif
In the blue 5S's
Sportin out tan, interior blue head restses
Move, baby no time for second guesses
Been articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses
Yo we gettin papers spreadin love and happiness's
Shit blazin so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby *chorus comes in*


Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby


Yo, word is bond
Baby let's get it on

Yo baby girl take off your thong
Let me put it in your spirit like the holy Kyron

Yo, honey body look real strong
Watch your ass swing
Hangin like a medallion
Exercise baby let me see you spread on the floor

Relax, I'm bout to give you some more
Where the liquor store 
Hit you with some more metaphor
The raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before
Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin their neck
Yo we play to win 
Such a shame, shit is a sin
So hot baby body heat bubble your skin
Everytime I flow speak

Just like the body guard Les straight walkin the street
We get down



Yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes 
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin dough
When we rippin the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe,  be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape 
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape
Like blah!!!!!!!!!!!

For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one


Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light


And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else shall be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light I'm flying

1998,82,Because of You,98 Degrees,,"You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all because of you
You're my sunshine, oh yeah

Baby I really know by now
Since we met that day
You showed me the way
I felt it then
you gave me love, I can't describe
How much I feel for you
I said baby I should have known by now
Should have been right there
whenever you gave me love
And if only you were here


Honestly could it be you and me
Like it was before neither less or more
'Cause when I close my eyes at night
I realize that no one else could ever take your place
I still can feel and it's so unreal
When you're touching me, kisses endlessly
It's just a place in the sun where our love's begun
I miss you, yes I miss you baby, oh yeah


If I knew how to tell you what's on my mind
The I'd always be there right by your side


You're my sunshine
You're my sunshine
Oh yeah
"
1998,83,The Mummers' Dance,Loreena McKennitt,,"When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak, and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern lightChorus:
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gayWho will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the yearThe songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland daysChorusAnd so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone""A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out

1998,84,All Cried Out,Allure,Pop,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, falling 
Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you...
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple  Hello 
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure 
My heart never knew such pain
Now I'm all cried out, over you

ooh
Cryin' over you, yeah

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?

Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance of these flames
Why should I take the blame?
Apology not accepted
At me to the broken hearts you've collected
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
Over you

I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you

You left me so confused

Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

so sorry baby, please forgive me
please forgive me

Hey yo I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, french countesse, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get HOOF


I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
Long as you show class, and pass my test
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna ghetto brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
""You nasty Twin!""  I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns

Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked


No more rollin with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad

1998,87,"Foolish Games"" / ""You Were Meant for Me",Jewel,Pop,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.

Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees, and...

These foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.

You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar.

Well, excuse me, coz I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself.

You'd teach me of honest things,
Things that were daring, things that were clean.
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.
I hid my soiled hands behind my back.
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone 
Off track with you.

Well, excuse me, coz I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself.

These foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.

You took your coat off,
Stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.

That you were just too damn dull for me
All that really mattered was you were my boyfriend
And baby that's all that matters to me

~Chorus~
Let me love you down, even if it takes all night
Let me love you down, you know it's got to be so right

Remember when you drove me home from work?
I loved the way when you kissed me bye
All of your friends think I'm just too young for you
So tell them that I can do what girls their age can do
Aw babe


It never really mattered too much to me
That they were just too damn blind to see
As long as I can love you down baby just be my man
That's all that matters to me


Let me love you down
Ooh

Let me love you down,
I know, I know I could
Love you down, down, Ooh
Love you down, down, no no no no no no no
Let me love you, I wanna love you, down
Let me love you, I wanna love you, down baby

1998,89,Do for Love,2Pac,Hip hop,"
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
that's right, sucka for love


What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do  So now I'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
sucka for love


Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
sucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love


I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
Sucka for love

1998,96,4 Seasons of Loneliness,Boyz II Men,,"I love for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try
When I get the courage up to love
somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just
can't compare to you
Your love won't release me I'm bound
under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as i watch 4
season's change
Chorus:
In come the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the
mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of
your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we
used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the
trees are bare
When  you're not here it doesn't feel
  the same
Remember the nights when we closed
our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be
in love for all time
Anytime I think about these things I
shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so
emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under
ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4
season's change
CHORUS
This loneliness
has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'cause I need your love to comfort me
and ease my pain
Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness
again

1998,97,Father,LL Cool J,Hip hop,"I swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth...
so help me GOD
I just felt like tellin the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that


If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
would you drown on purpose or try to survive
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone
Come on


All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
was a father
That's all!
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed... was a father


Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin down at me standin on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me



My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possesed by a demon... a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
when your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real



My head was spinnin, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops dissapeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
until I started gettin beatings everday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
a young child, wishin the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

that I'm gonna have to up and go 
if you keep giving it up cutting up 
and acting fast giving up the ass 
I love you but I had enough 
do it again it's gonna be your last 
I can forgive but won't forget the 
things you did 
you'll soon regret ever dissin' me 
'cause this could be the end of we 
can't you see 
girl you're hurting me 

Repeat Chorus three times 

For the life of me I just can't conceive 
why I just can't leave you 
why you do this to me baby 
I feel like a fool 
but what can I do your love gots me weak baby 
why must I endure your constant greed 
your endles need to be so damn freaky 
now I understand 'cause it wasn't for me 
yes pay backs a mother baby 

Oh why tell me why whey are you so freaky 
tell me why, why are you so freaky

1998,99,Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,Deborah Cox,R&b,"I've spent all my life, on a search to find 
The love who'll stay for eternity 
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs 
But when I turn around 
Again, love has knocked me down 
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad 
I'm sad to say, love wins again 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

How did you get here 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
I've tried that love thing for the last time 
My heart says no, no! 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
But you came along and changed my mind 

This time I swear I'm through 
But if only you knew 
How many times I've said those words 
Then fall again, when will I ever learn 
Knowing these tears I cry 
This lovely black butterfly 
Must take a chance, and spread my wings 
Love can make you do some crazy things 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

No, nobody, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh!

1998,100,Westside,TQ,R&b,"This is going out to the whole wide Westside
you know what i'm saying,
yeah break it down for me
steady mob, rock, rock on

I was just a young boy, livin in the hub city-Eastside Compton G
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every Nigga
Talking 'bout boy you can't fuck with me
Remember Ice T had da power, hearing gunshots lickin' by the hour
When Too Short bumped in every supersport
And taught us all how to ride for the West Coast 

To my peoples if you with me - where you at 
Throw your dubs in the air - and wave 'em like you just don't care 
From LA to the Bay - what you say - all day... everyday... any damn day 
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down 
Going on and on, it don't stop...won't stop... can't stop 
Either ride or die - that's why i put it down for the westside 

Mama started tripping so it's time to go 
Up to the park with the locsta's 
Everybody broke, smokin' roaches 
DJ Quik was the shit had every nigga claiming he was from the CPT 
Ya'll remember one-time tried to clown 
We had to burn this bitch on down 

One time for my niggas in incarceration 
I blaze a dime with you for having lots of patience 
Two times for my sista's at the county building 
I got some westside love for all you ghetto children 
Three times for my niggas that done passed away 
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days 
One day everything's gonna be fine 
But until that day my only reply is... 
WESTSDIE TILL I DIE

From Crenshaw to Foothill Blvd. 
All i see are Lo Lo's and mob cars - Daytons and five stars 
All the true hobs is hittin' switches 
With all the finest riches of course the bombest bitches 
Don't get it twisted Ask me what's a real G 
Show me a nigga scrapping back against the wall until his knuckles bleed 
Screaming death to all our enemies and those who don't believe 
WEST COAST LIVIN' BE THE SHIT TO ME!!!

1999,1,Believe,Cher,Electropop,"
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Chorus:

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh


Well I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

1999,2,No Scrubs,TLC,R&b,"A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass


I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

There's a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cuz I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass



If you don't have a car and you're walking 
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Wanna get with me with no money

No



See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs never risin'
I don't find it surprisin'
If you don't have the g's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screen
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular
And then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho
Not really, T-Boz and all my senoritas
Is steppin' on your Filas
But you don't hear me though

When I first saw you I already knew 
There was something inside of you 
Something I thought that I would never find

I looked at you looking at me 
Now I know why they say the best things are free 
I'm gonna love you boy you are so fine 
Angel of mine 

How you changed my world you'll never know

Hook: 
You came into my life sent from above 
When I lost all hope you showed me love 
I'm checkin' for you boy your right on time 
Angel of Mine 

Verse 2: 
Nothing means more to me than what we shared 
No one in this whole world can ever compare 
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind 
Angel of Mine 

What you mean to me you'll never know 
Deep inside I need to show 

Repeat Hook 

I never knew I could feel each moment 
As if they were new 
Every breath that I take 
The love that we make 
I only share it with you

How you changed my world you'll never know 
I'm different now you helped me grow

1999,4,Heartbreak Hotel,Whitney Houston,R&b,"You said that you'd be here by nine 
And said you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why you do this to me


Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is hat I have to say: 
All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you play with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you been doing wrong 
You played me all along. 
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me. 
How could you do it to me

Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing em upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

for a century of lonely nights

Waiting for someone to release me

You're licking your lips

And blowing kisses my way

But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away








If you wanna be with me

Baby there's a price to pay

I'm a genie in a bottle

You gotta rub me the right way

If you wanna be with me

I can make your wish come true

You gotta make a big impression

I gotta like what you do


I'm a genie in a bottle baby

You Gotta rub me the right way honey

I'm a genie in a bottle baby

Come, come, come on and let me out


The music's fading

The lights down low

Just one more dance

And then were gonna go

Waiting for someone

Who needs me

Hormones racing at the speed of light

But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight








If you wanna be with me

Baby there's a price to pay


You gotta rub me the right way


I can make your wish come true 


Just come and set me free

And I'll be with you

from the corner of my girlfriend's four post bed
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
the weekend or a one-night stand
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
and you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again
Oh...........
Oh................
Oh.......
Every Morning there's a heartache hanging
from the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me

Something so deceiving
When you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again

Only to find that one won't give their heart to you

Have you ever closed your eyes and 

Dreamed that they were there

And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

What do I gotta say to get to your heart 

To make you understand how I need you next to me

Gotta get you in my world

1999,17,All Star,Smash Mouth,Alternative rock,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored


Somebody once asked could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

1999,18,Angel,Sarah McLachlan,,"Spend all your time waiting for that second chance   
For the break that will make it OK   
There's always some reason to feel not good enough   
And it's hard at the end of the day   
I need some distraction or a beautiful release   
Memories seep from my veins   
Let me be empty and weightless and maybe   
I'll find some peace tonight   

In the arms of the Angel far away from here   
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear   
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie  
You're in the arms of the Angel; may you find some comfort here   

So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn   
There's vultures and thieves at your back   
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies   
That you make up for all that you lack   
It don't make no difference, escaping one last time   
It's easier to believe   
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness   
That brings me to my knees   

In the arms of the Angel far away from here   
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear   
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie  
In the arms of the Angel; may you find some comfort here   

You're in the arms of the Angel; may you find some comfort here

1999,19,Smooth,Santana,Latin rock,"Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My Muсequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that could be so smooth
Give me your heart make it real 
Or else forget about it

Well I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it be a crying shame
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways 
But it's all the same
At the end of the day 
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up 
That M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in the position to make me feel 
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things 
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you 

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways 
But it's all the same
At the end of the day

The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin tires, the bustin glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up the rain was pourin down
There were people standin all around
Something warm flowing through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed

Well now she's gone
Even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Never seen a sun shine like this 

Never seen the moon glow like this 

Never seen the waterfalls like this 

Never seen the lights off like this 

Never dug anyone like this 

Never had tasty lips to kiss 

Never had someone to miss 

Never wrote a song quite like this 




Fortunate to have you girl, 

I'm so glad you're in my world, 

Just as sure as the sky is blue, 

I bless the day that I found you. 




Never had room service all night 

Never took a trip first class flight 

Never had a love affair so tight 

I've never felt a feeling so right 

Never seen a winter so white 

Never had words to recite 

Never had a flame to ignite 

And I never sang a song with all my might. 




Silence child hope you hear 

I'm callin out to your body 

Baby you know just what to do 

Close the door no interlude

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart
I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

Even listening to a word you say
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does his friends get all your time
Baby please
I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine


All the money in the world could never add up to all the love
I have inside... I love you

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you

Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you

1999,28,What It's Like,Everlast,Blues rock,"We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change 
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange 
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes 
""Get a job you ****ing slob,"" is all he replies 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues 

Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love 
He said, ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll 
I'm the man you've been dreaming of."" 
But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her calls 
And she swear, ""God damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls."" 
And then she heads for the clinic and 
she gets some static walking through the door 
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner 
and they call her a whore 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 
'cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose 

Chorus 

I've seen a rich man beg 
I've seen a good man sin 
I've seen a tough man cry 
I've seen a loser win 
And a sad man grin 
I heard an honest man lie 
I've seen the good side of bad 
And the downside of up 
And everything between 
I licked the silver spoon 
Drank from the golden cup 
And smoked the finest green 
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times 
before I broke their heart 
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start 

I knew this kid named Max 
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs 
He liked to hang out late 
he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs 
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head 
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead 
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain 
You know it crumbles that way 
at least that's what they say when you play the game 
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose 

Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like...to have to lose

This place is war without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say you were always there for me
Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time
And'll fade away
And'll fade away
So far, so long, so far away

1999,36,I Still Believe,Mariah Carey,Pop,"You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again.

"
1999,37,The Hardest Thing,98 Degrees,,"We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And baby it's killing me, it's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that 

Chorus:
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever had to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you 

I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you will never know
There can be no happy ending 

Chorus 

Maybe another time, another day
As much as I want to, I can't stay
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that 

Chorus 

I don't want to live a lie
What can I do

1999,40,Jumper,Third Eye Blind,Alternative rock,"I wish you would step back 
From that ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again 
I would understand, I would understand 
The angry boy a bit too insane 
Icing over a secret pain 
You know you don't belong 
You're the first to fight 
You're way too loud 
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud 
I know something's wrong 
Well everyone I know has got a reason 
To say put the past away 
I wish you would step back 
From that ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again 
I would understand, I would understand 
Well he's on the table and he's gone to code 
And I do not think anyone knows 
What they're doing here 
And your friends have left you 
You've been dismissed 
I never thought it would come to this 
And I, I want you to know 
Everyone's got to face down the demons 
Maybe today 
You could put the past away 
I wish you would step back from 
That ledge my friend 
You could cut ties with all the lies 
That you've been living in 
And if you do not want to see me again

1999,41,Doo Wop (That Thing),Lauryn Hill,Doo-wop,"It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you probably f*** again
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas f***ed up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the child's support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the s***n stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again

Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

Then they hung out 
But you came home around three 
If six of y'all went out 
Then four of you were really cheap 
Cause only two of you had dinner 
I found your credit card receipt 

It's not right 
But it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Pack your bags up and leave 
Don't you dare come running back to me 
It's not right 
But it's okay 
I'm gonna make it anyway 
Close the door behind you 
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone 
Than unhappy 

I'll pack your bags 
So you can leave town for a week 
The phone rings 
And then you look at me 
You said it was one of your friends 
Down on 54th St. 
So why did 213 
Show up on your Caller I.D. 

I've been through all of this before 
So how could you think 
That I would stand around 
And take some more 
Things are gonna change 
That's why you have to leave 
So don't turn around to see my face 
There's no more fears and tears 
For you to see 

Was it really worth you going out like that 
See I'm moving on 
And I refuse to turn back 
See all of this time 
I thought I had somebody down for me 
It turns out 
You were making a fool of mee

1999,46,Lullaby,Shawn Mullins,,"Lullaby

She grew up with the children of the stars in the Hollywood hills and the boulevard 
Her parents threw big parties, everyone was there 
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper, Bob Seger, Sonny and Cher 
Now, she feels safe in the bar on Fairfax 
And from the stage I can tell that 
She can't let go and she can't relax 
And just before she hangs her head to cry 
I sing to her a lullaby, I sing everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
She still lives with her mom outside the city 
Down that street about a half a mile 
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty 
But she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while 
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown 
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town 
But, everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
I told her I ain't so sure about this place 
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face 
Seems like everyone here's got a plan 
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan 
But, everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
Everything's gonna be all right

Just stand there I could say so much 

But I don't go there cuz I don't want to 

I was thinking if you were lonely 

Maybe we could leave here and no one would know 

At least not to the point that we would think so 


Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about 

Somebody else 

It's best if we all keep it under our heads 

I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do 

But I'm lonely now, and I don't know how 

To get it back to good 


This don't mean that, you own me 

This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell 

But things worked out just like you wanted too 

If you see me out you don't know me 

Try to turn your head, try to give me some room 

To figure out just what I'm going to do 


And everyone here, hates everyone here for doing just like 

They do 

It's best if we all keep this quiet instead 

And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like 

They do 

But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how 

To get it back to good 


Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with 

Somebody else 

Everyone here's to blame, everyone here 

Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, everyone hides 

Shades of shame, but looking inside we're the same, we're 

The same 

And we're all grown now, but we don't know how 

To get it back to good 


Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout 

Somebody else 

It's best if we all keep this under our heads 

I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do 

But it's over now, and I don't know how, it's over now

But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's gonna happen

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high, high above me

First class and fancy free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything

What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother?


She calls to speak to me
I freeze immediately
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal

'Cause somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothing's gonna happen

Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican

But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
So I'm thinkin I'ma scoot me somethin hot
In this south-sea merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas, with the hot mommies
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your door 
We flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth

Verse 3: Will Smith

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on

An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mierda, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em

It would be that we're all OK
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these

For light does the darkness most fear
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
And I am never broken
Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing
My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
I am never broken

In the end only kindness matters
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray

1999,56,Please Remember Me,Tim McGraw,Country,"When all our tears have reached the sea 
Part of you will live in me 
Way down deep inside my heart 
The days keep coming without fail 
A new wind is gonna find your sail 
That's where your journey starts 

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was 
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun 
Please remember me 

Just like the waves down by the shore 
We're gonna keep on coming back for more 
Cause we don't ever wanna stop 
Out in this brave new world you seek 
Oh, the valleys and the peaks 
And I can see you on the top 

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was 
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun 
Please remember me 

Remember me when you're out walkin' 
When the snow falls high outside your door 
br> Late at night when you're not sleepin' And light falls across your floor 
When I can't hurt you anymore 

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was 
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun 
Please remember me 

Please remember me

and I will always care.

Through weakness and strength,

happiness and sorrow,

for better, for worse,

I will love you with every beat of my heart.)

From this moment you are the one

Right beside you is where I belong

From this moment I have been blessed

I live only for your happiness

And for your love I'd give my last breath

From this moment on


I give my hand to you with all my heart

Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start

You and I will never be apart

My dreams came true because of you


From this moment as long as I live

I will love you, I promise you this

There is nothing I wouldn't give

From this moment on


You're the reason I believe in love

And you're the answer to my prayers from up above

All we need is just the two of us

From this moment as long as I live

I will love you, I promise you this

There is nothing I wouldn't give

From this moment on

I will love you as long as I live

And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb

And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah

And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Always someone there

And there's no time left for losin'
When you stand they fall, yeah

And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Comin' down the years turn over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and

Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light

And I will remember you

my mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted round and beat 
uncomfortable three feet deep 
now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
impaired my tribal lunar-speak
and of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
so i missed a million miles of fun
i know it's up for me
if you steal my sunshine
making sure i'm not in too deep
if you steal my sunshine
keeping versed and on my feet
if you steal my sunshine
i was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
l-a-t-e-r that week
my sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
an incredible eight foot heap
now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
involved an under usual feat
and i'm not only among but i invite who i want to come
so i missed a million miles of fun
i know it's up for me
if you steal my sunshine
making sure i'm not in too deep
if you steal my sunshine
keeping versed and on my feet
if you steal my sunshine
i know it's done for me
if you steal my sunshine
not as some and hard to see
if you steal my sunshine
keeping dumb and built to beat
if you steal my sunshine
my sunshine
if you steal my sunshine

1999,79,I Need to Know,Marc Anthony,Latin,"La gente anda diciendo por alli
que tu quisieras acercarte a mi
Si tu supieras que te quiero amar
que hasta el cielo te quiero llevar


No me dejes solo con mi corazon
que esta enloquecido con esta pasion
Si es que me deseas nena dimelo
porque por tu amor estoy muriendo yo
Ay dimelo, ven dimelo
porque por tu amor estoy muriendo yo
Ay dimelo, ven dimelo
porque por tu amor estoy muriendo yo

Si yo pudiera acariciar tu piel
Tu cuerpo entero quiero conocer
Esta pasion no me deja dormir
Este deseo no me deja vivir

1999,81,Faded Pictures,Case,,"
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Check it

And all I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the grooving of love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

Was a photograph she took years ago
How could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time


Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
Cuz it's breaking my heart
So won't you stare into the glass


As she turned through the pages, the tears roll down her face
I could see her reminiscing why her life had to be this way
Then she stopped as she came to a page where her diary ends
To smell the scent of an old rose from her lover I suppose


The pictures keep spinning
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
Cuz she's lost inside the past

The pictures keep spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
Cuz she's lost inside the past
Lost inside the past

1999,83,When a Woman's Fed Up,R. Kelly,R&b,"I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying  quot;damn quot; to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through 
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

It ain't nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill 
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

It ain't nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it

La da da da da la la da da
La da da da da la la da da
If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

It ain't nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it

You can cry a river 
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember 
Cuz she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see 
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois 
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
I said I miss you baby

Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tannin' senioritas

Hands on the wheel, cruisin' down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonights the night, feels like perfect timin'
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes
I wanna know how forever feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you

1999,86,Sometimes,Britney Spears,Bubblegum pop,"You tell me you're in love with me 
like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me 
it's not that I don't want to stay

I wanna believe in everything that you say 
'cause it sounds so good 
but if you really want me, move slow

sometimes I run 
sometimes I hide 
sometimes I'm scared of you

treat you right, be with you day and night

I don't wanna be so shy

1999,87,Ghetto Cowboy,Mo Thugs,Midwest hip hop,"The name is Krazie, big bad ass bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
That that there's kidnapped, now she was with her 
so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heep of trouble
Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't 
been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure thats enough time for me to get the whole 
run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin dark so now now I'm watchin for them 
damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin, tootin damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the 
bushes
Stop my horse "";wwhhooaa nellie"";
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let 
my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the law
Jumped out the bushes with my sawed off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse 
stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my 
head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them 
bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of Bob
But I could use her for the job so I told her to 
ride c'mon
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty 
penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you wit it
We hurry 'for the sunrise
Gotta stallion for ya parter to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride, lets ride
These directions say we got to Tucson Arizona
When we arrive we cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and 
hookups
Rise and shine, good morning howdy
Nine o clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the 
valley
Now I done came along way I don't wanna be late
Tell him we make it to him
I'm peepin Krazyie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin 
ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie 
just might take his life
So I approach him at a pause
Look man I really don't wanna brawl, why don't you 
chill
Before the them laws come messing up this master 
plan
Since y'all 'ready rowdy I just ask ya man, hey
You want some work, well partna put in ya bid
Now by the was whats ya name they call me Layzie 
the kid
The names Powder P can I get a twelve gauge
Outlawed everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzies in 
town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and dont' be stealin nobodys damn 
horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie Kid, you son of a 
gun!
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner powder hes a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet you son
Oh yeah you know I also brought a friend along 
Meet thug queen the horse peddler

Howdy partner
Already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbing banks
Like you rustle that cattle
Now y'all

1999,88,Out of My Head,Fastball,,"Out Of My Head 
Lyrics and music: Tony Scalzo


Sometimes I feel 
Like I am drunk behind the wheel 
The wheel of possibility 
However it may roll 
Give it a spin 
See if you can somehow factor in 
You know there's always more than one way 
To say exactly what you mean to say 

Chorus: 
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind? 
How could I have ever been so blind? 
I was waiting for an indication 
It was hard to find 
Don't matter what I say only what I do 
I never mean to do bad things to you 
So quiet but I finally woke up 
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too 

Chorus 
Repeat Chorus

1999,90,Jamboree,Naughty by Nature,Hip hop,"I wanna see y'all who wanna plan with me
Wave your hands across the land if we family
Say hot-damn hot-damn we wanna jamboree
This is for my peeps here I stand for you cause you stand for me
C'mon I know I jam, I know I jam jam, while oh damn
I know I jam, I know I jam jam boree
I know I jam, I know I jam jam while oh damn why don't you Jamboree for me?
Yes, Indeed
Kaboom kaboom the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims smoked sims whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw from whoo'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill but I cut for the cars
Smokin' budda with a hoota' get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters leed a luga with duga
Some say modeling and acting mean treach is selling
Hella heated, I'm too ill for them to beat it
We the most cheated most weeded most needed
You best believe it
Lets take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
Your'e damned to be without the jamboree
We've put it down since the days of high school 
and everywhere we Mark we rule
Naughty's about to raise our stock
And we didn't come to brag about what we got nigga
We came to rock
We blew the spot taking the streets to pac
Using the last few years as our evidence
Niggas been tryin' to duplicate the mixture ever since
You live in value reprimanding
If you challenge me I guarantee
When we finish I'll be the last man standing
Fuck what you heard naughty is forever in demand when
Kay drop tracks all the party people jammin'
I wanna see y'all who wanna plan with me
Wave your hands across the land if we family
Say hot-damn hot-damn we wanna jamboree
This is for my peeps here I stand for you cause you stand for me
I ask the thugs who have mercy in these days is dirty
I'm still sturdy and flirty till my derby for jersey
The funk is pass-booted lights-camera-shoot it
I just did it to do it that's why I suit it and boot it
Here's the graphic niggas is just tattered and added
Orgy's are automatic from back-traffic to addicts
Crush the cabbage straight from the savage to lavish
We rip those who rat it thats why your click had it
Cause we'll drop a cuzzie that leaves your whole label woozy
And shitty and dizzy because your whole city miss me
And whip out they titties
And from they kiddies throw me 50's in bundles of 100's
And make every hater want it 
Drunk and blunt it knock onto the hottest nigga comin'
Kay scratch and cut ya no matta what you make or
Wanna come and touch her the punani rusher like Usher

Cuz I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cuz sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

I'm that feeling when you can't leave.
It won't stop)

Along aside your body, make you open up your world,

Lick your body up and down,
Make you feel alright {I can almost taste you},

I wanna hit the four seasons, lie with you,
Roll backward, get high with you,
Let the jet fall out the sky, die with you,
Bonny and Clyde, ghetto bride,
Push my love aside, get you right,

Gangsta love, love how we chill together,
Count mills together,
Niggas front, get ill together,
Playas hate, but we still together,
A name, for me to praise,
To my dyin days, and I see the grave,
So whatchu wanna do love


You make me feel like,
I've been locked down for years,
And ain't had none,
Strictly magnon,
Plus together, nothin better,
What I feel for you, my treasure,
There through it all, thick and thin, take the pressure,
Come, real bitch, feel this, real love, what an affair,


How you want me baby
Butt naked on some rug shit
Or thugged out on some Cryps and some Bloods shit,
It's your call, the queen do it all,
Anything you do for me, I do 10 times more,
Forget the small talk, let me sit on your face,
Rockin moves like a hoola hoop around my waist,
Pushin fantasies, can I fulfill your wish,
Whooo! Whooo! Time to get freaky, freaky,
Get my Price cd, do me babyy.
Let's get married so you can have a son for me.)
Not now baby, stick your tongue in me,
Make me feel good, I might let you cum in me,
Make me wanna go public,
Tell the whole world that I'm your girl,
Take pictures with our moms on the cover of New York Times,
Grew up bad, just like his mom and dad,
A real nigga is all I want, all I ever had,
Things you do, give a bitch to choose,
Like writing out ""I Love You"" in hundered dollar bills,
Feed each other fruits like kiwi and mango,
Rock kangos, while we do the durango,
And when we fight, we both get bruised,
Lie to everybody, say they matchin tattoos,
My nigga got beef, ain't shit you can tell me,
I cut a nigga's throat like Shaquita from Bellarmy.
I wanna house in Africa,  in my back yard,
Businesses surrounded by security guards,
With a big ass club called ""Kim n Him""
And a crew full of dollars I can go spend with him.

One foot gettin' deeper 
With a broken mirror 
And a blown out speaker

I'm faded, flat busted 
Been jaded, I been dusted 
I know that I've seen better days 

One foot in the hole 
One foot gettin' deeper crank it to eleven

Find myself here all the time 
Another rip in the glass 
Another chip in my tooth 
Rained on, I've been stained on 
Found another goat I put the blame on 
Now I'm steppin' on all the cracks 
But I guess there ain't no use 
I'm bent like glass second hand like glory 
Missed the bus but I'm in no hurry 
Molasses fast, no business born 

One foot in the hole 
One foot gettin' deeper crank it to eleven 
Blow another speaker 
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose 

Cuz I've seen better days 
Been the star of many plays 
I've seen better days 
And the bottom drops out 

I've seen better days 
Been the star of many plays 
I've seen better days 
And the bottom drops out

I'll sign it at the bottom of this page
I'll swear under oath

And I think you need to know

Oh I love you and I don't want you to go

1999,99,When You Believe,Whitney Houston,Pop,"Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts, a hopeful song
We barely understood

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could, oh yes

Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

Oh yeah, in this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'll say


They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice 
Says hope is very near, oh


You will when you
You will when you believe
Just believe
I believe, I believe
Just believe
You will when you believe

1999,100,(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You,Alabama,Pop,"Words and Music by Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry
Drinkin' was forbidden in my Christian country home
I learned to play the flattop on them good ol' Gospel songs
Then I heard about the barrooms just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a livin' playin' guitar late at night
Had to learn about the ladies; too young to understand
why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away
to some other guitar picker in some other late night place
Yeah, I held on to my music; I let the ladies walk away
took my songs and dreams to Nashville and then on to L.A.
Up to New York City, all across the USA
Chorus:
..home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama, Southern born and Southern bred
What keeps me goin'? I don't really know.
can't be the money the Lord knows I'm always broke
could it be the satisfaction of bein' understood
when the people really love ya and let you know when it's good
Well I'll speak my Southern English just as natural as I please
I'm in the heart of Dixie, Dixie's in the heart of me
and someday when I make it, when love finds a way
somewhere high on Lookout Mountain I'll just smile with pride and say that my

2000,1,Breathe,Faith Hill,Country pop,"I can feel the magic floating in the air 
Being with you gets me that way 
I watch the sunlight dance across your face 
And I, I've never been this swept away 

All my thoughts just seem 
To settle on the breeze 
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms 
The whole world just fades away 
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart 

Cause I can feel you breathe 
It's washing over me 
And suddenly I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch 
A slow and steady rush 
And baby isn't that the way 
That love's supposed to be 
I can feel you breathe 
Just breathe 

In a way I know my heart is waking up 
As all the walls come crumbling down 
Closer than I've ever felt before 
And I know and you know 
There's no need for words right now 

Cause I can feel you breathe 
It's washing over me 
And suddenly I'm melting into you 
There's nothing left to prove 
Baby all we need is just to be 
Caught up in the touch 
A slow and steady rush 
And baby isn't that the way 
That love's supposed to be 
I can feel you breathe 

Cause I can feel you breathe 
It's washing over me 
And suddenly I'm melting into you

2000,2,Smooth,Santana,Latin rock,"Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My Muсequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that could be so smooth
Give me your heart make it real 
Or else forget about it

Well I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it be a crying shame
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say 


But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for 

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return 

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be

At exactly the right time

But some things you just don't question

a little crazy but I believe 


I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life 

There's just no rhyme or reason
only this sense of completion
and in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I found my way home

a little crazy but I believe

I am complete now that I found you

Time and time again 
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep

'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape 
From the life I live when I'm awake 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay 

Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change 
It helps me to appreciate 
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same 
The only difference is 
To let love replace all our hate 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape 
Come on, let's go there 
Let's ask can we stay 

Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets

So lets go there, lets go there,
Come on, lets go there
Lets ask can we stay

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 

Can you take me Higher
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher 
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me Higher

Can you take me Higher

Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together. 

While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched, 

'Cause in my heart was a picture of us: 

Holding hands, making plans, 

And it's lucky for me, you understand. 


What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 

And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever keeps me in your arms. 

And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 


A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith 

Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together. 

While I figured it out, they say, ""If you love something let it go. 

If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know. 

It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure."" 



What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 

And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever keeps me in your arms. 

And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 


Somebody sensitive and tough; 

Somebody there when the going gets rough; 

Every night, he'll be giving his love 

To just one girl... one girl... one. 

Somebody cool but real tender too; 

Somebody, baby, just like you 

Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew. 

I'm thankin' you for being there for me. 


What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 

And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly... 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 

Whatever keeps me in your arms. 

And I'm thanking you for being there for me.

When will they stop

I believe that fate has brought us here

And we should be together

But wer,e not

I play it off but I'm dreamin of you

I'll keep it cool but I'm fiendin.

I try to say goodbye and I choke

I try to walk away and I stumble

Though I try to hide it it's clear 

My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke

I try to walk away and I stumble

Though I try to hide it, it's clear

My world crumbles when you are not near


I may appear to be free

But I'm just a prisoner of your love

I may seem alright and smile when you leave

But my smiles are just a front

I play it off but I'm dreamin of you 

I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin

I try to say goodbye and I choke

I try to walk away and I stumble

Though I try to hide it it's clear

My world crumbles when you are not near


Here is my confession

May I be your possesion 

Boy I need your touch

Your love kisses and such

With all my might I try

But this I can't deny

I play it off but im dreamin of you

Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what?  Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
and it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it?  How me and money end up hangin
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Chorus

Who say pretty boys can't be wild niggaz?
Loud niggaz, O.K. Corral niggaz
Foul niggaz, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga
How nigga?  Ask me again and it's goin down nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown nigga
Pound niggaz, what you be givin when I'm around nigga
Frown niggaz, talkin shit when I leave the town nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules Boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo' +Third Question+ like A.I.
Say hi, to my niggaz left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town

Smokin blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill' like I'm Hammer

Making her promises never for real!

Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes! 
How many days disapeer

Your clothes never wear as well the next day! 
And your hair never falls in quite the same way! 
But you never seem to run out of things to say!...

To put up with every day and all day! for the music video)
How did we wind up this way 
Watching our mouths for the words that we say. 
As long as we stand here waiting, 
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose! 
How do we get there today 
When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes! 
Your clothes never wear as well the next day! 
And your hair never falls in quite the same way!

I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold 

Look out my windo to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I'm all alone

Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby just give me a sing

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with  you
Wanna be with you

I can't sleep and I'm up all night
Through these tears I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life

Don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you some how


And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you

Runnin' your mouth about

Could've had it good

In the backseat piece spilling Henney in his lap 
Thought it was me you was all about 
But I'm having doubts 
Cause I see you try-na play me out 
But when the brother called the crib with beef 
Didn't I represent you? 
When I caught him in the streets 
So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks 
And no more hanging brigets around your neck, babe 

Does he lace you with the finer things? 
Does he make ya wanna scream his name? 
Does he hit it from the front to back?

In your eyes I know I'll find the light

To light my way.

And when I'm scared,

And losing ground,

When my world is going crazy,

You can turn it all around.

And when I'm down you're there

You're always there,

giving me all you've got.

For a shield from the storm,

For a friend, for a love

to keep me safe and warm

I turn to you.

For the strength to be strong,

For the will to carry on

For everything you do,

for everything that's true

I turn to you.

When I lose the will to win,

I just reach for you and

I can reach the sky again.

I can do anything

'Cause your love is so amazing,

'Cause your love inspires me.


And when I need a friend,

You're always on my side

Giving me faith

that gets me through the night.

For a shield from the storm,

For a friend, for a love

to keep me safe and warm

I turn to you.

For the strength to be strong,

For the will to carry on

For everything you do,

for everything that's true

I turn to you.

For the arms to be my shelter

through all the rain,

For truth that will never change,

For someone to lean on,

For a heart I can rely on through anything,

For that one who I can run to...

For a shield from the storm,

For a friend, for a love

to keep me safe and warm

Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I've finally found a man that's true
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying 
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream 
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do 
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
Cause I need you in my life

Somehow became reality
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you 


See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows 
that we were destined to shine 
After the rain to appreciate 
And care for what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
My every wish and every dream 
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful

 I wake in pain
 I dream of love as time runs through my hand

 I dream of fire
 Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
 And in the flames 
 Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

 This desert rose
 Each of her veils, a secret promise
 This desert flower
 No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

 And as she turns
 This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
 This fire burns
 I realise that nothing's as it seems

 I dream of rain
 I dream of gardens in the desert sand
 I wake in pain
 I dream of love as time runs through my hand

 I dream of rain
 I lift my gaze to empty skies above
 I close my eyes, this rare perfume
 Is the sweet intoxication of her love

 I dream of rain
 I dream of gardens in the desert sand
 I wake in pain
 I dream of love as time runs through my hand

 Sweet desert rose
 Each of her veils, a secret promise

 This memory of Eden haunts us all
 This desert flower, this rare perfume
 Is the sweet intoxication of the fall

May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here..

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, 
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots! 
Feminist women love Eminem
""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who,""  ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes


I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird""
Why  So you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""
I should download her audio on MP3 
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!


I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it 
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!"" 
with his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go


Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world is so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't wanna hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna hear you say
You both have grown in a different way
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna meet your friends
And I don't wanna start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Some days I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now...

I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends

I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me

 Oh, you shouldn't have 

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby

2000,56,I Wanna Love You Forever,Jessica Simpson,Pop,"You set my soul at ease 
Chased darkness out of view 
Left your desperate spell on me 
Say you feel it to 
I know you do 
I've got so much more to give 
This can't die, I yearn to live 
Pour yourself all over me 
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees 

I wanna love you forever 
And this is all I'm asking of you 
10,000 lifetimes together 
Is that so much for you to do 
Cuz from the moment that I saw your face 
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace 
I swear I knew. 
I'm gonna love you forever 

My mind fails to understand 
What my heart tells me to do 
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you 
and that would do 
I've always been taught to win 
And I never thought I'd fall 
Be at the mercy of a man 
I've never been 
Now I only want to be right where you are. 


In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no 
Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday 
Cuz when I'm with you there's nowhere else 
That I would ever wanna be no 
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you 
Loving me ... I'm gonna love

I thought it up it brought up the past

Stranger things could never change my mind

Push the trigger and pull the thread

Burn me out leave me on the otherside

2000,64,I Wish,Carl Thomas,R&b,"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me


Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it hurts
Someone that you lose


I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
Wish I never, wish I never

Trailing on you and your homies 
The very first day of summer 
All chromed out in a hummer babe 
Hit the park and parle 
Hope that your off is away 
Cause you and your girls wanna ride 
Play all day, puff on the lye 

Ooh say what, say what, say what

I'm digging you, I'm feeling you 
And you know what's up 
Said I'm big on you and I'm wanting you 
So tell me what's up 

Be 'bout five niggaz zoning 
Running around two in the morning 
Looking fly with that sun dress on 
I think I feel a bone coming on 
Girl you got me wide open 
Fiending all day and I'm hoping 
So baby don't front 
Back seat jeep, you know what I want 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 

Uh, say what? say what? say what? 
So baby tell me what's up 
Can we ascend to higher heights 
And when the path gets rough 
We can give into Friday nights breath we peace 
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap 
Our souls to keep 
The passion's deep and filled with heat 
Living this life on the hustle I barely get enough time 
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine 
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world 
A reputation known as the untouchable girl 
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways 
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days 
Now we can play, past ways, or just ain't got time 
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine 
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by 
You and I don't need permission to be unified 
Surely I done seen and heard a million places 
Then I travel around the world, see many faces 
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true 
You can show me that nobody else can do it better than you 
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got 
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots

I've been trying to figure out
What I'm gonna say to you to get something, yeah

Couldn't baby you and I be better friends

Can we get it on

Kind of faded, but I'm feeling alright
Thinkin' about making my move tonight
I can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holdin' my body tight
'Cause I like the way you're making your move
I like the way you're making me wait
At the end of the night, I'm gonna make you feel like mine
You'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know you've got it?
And you know I want it
I don't want to be rude at all
I just want to be where you go

2000,67,Only God Knows Why,Kid Rock,Country,"I've been sittin here
Tryin to find myself
I get behind myself
I need to rewind myself
Lookin for the payback
Listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one
Yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son
And it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills it helps to ease the pain
I made a couple of dollar bills, but still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name
They say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me
It's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay
To be some big shot like I am
Out strecthed hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around

Yeah
As it...hey

And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around

People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit that I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I forgot all things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times
And I still stand firm
You get what you put in
And people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine
No I ain't seen mine
I've been giving just ain't been gettin
I've been walking that there line
So I think I'll keep a walking
With my head held high
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why

Only God
Only God
Only God knows why, why, why, why
Only God...knows...why, why, why
Only God knows why

No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
to add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?  Hoe please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?

The Snoop D-O-double-G's
and the group that said mother-""Fuck Tha Police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
to bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good
who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped 
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
so FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME!
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin around wit me
and turn me back to the old me


Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say

One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge
when I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage {*CRUNCH*}
Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off
""Fuck you too bitch, call the cops!""
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
{*Eminem's vocal turntable*}
Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies 
in a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up 
when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me

Chorus

If it was up to me, you muh'fuckers would stop comin up to me 
wit your hands out lookin up to me, like you want somethin free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
I told em all - all them little gangstas 
Who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
tryin to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin that; this is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque 
and fuck rap!  You can have it back
So where's all the Madd Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats, know that I was strapped wit gats
when you were cuddlin a Cabbage Patch

Chorus

2000,74,That's the Way,Jo Dee Messina,Country,"Everybody wants an easy ride on the merry-go-round that we call life 
Take a drive on cruise control, then you wake to find it's a winding road 
I had my dreams in view when the money ran out and the engine blew 
Hung my tears out to dry, then my dreams fell outta the clear blue sky 
And I, I was walking in the clouds feeling so safe and sound 
'Til something else knocks me down 
Chorus: 
Oh and that's the way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
Oh and that's the way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 
You live, you learn 
You crash, you burn 
And that's the way it is 

One fine day you wake up, completely, hopelessly fallen in love 
He's just what you're looking for, the only problem is that the man's not sure 
Another guy will give you everything, the only problem is you don't feel a thing 
Well I know from experience, nothing's ever gonna make perfect sense 
Oh, one day you get what you want, but it's not what you think, then you get what you need 


Chorus: 
Oh and that's the way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
Oh and that's the way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 
You live, you learn 
You crash, you burn 
And that's the way it is 

Yea 
They say your soul is growing 
But sometimes I feel like throwing something 
And that's they way it is 
You gotta roll with the punches 
And that's they way it goes 
You gotta bend when the wind blows 

Repeat chorus

2000,75,Swear It Again,Westlife,Pop,"I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they were lying

Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street just you and I 
Just you and I

All:
I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
Cos I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

All over again 

Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying
Cos in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye
But even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad

And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know
Oh that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I

I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry

And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad

2000,77,From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,Britney Spears,Teen pop,"Never look back,  we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go

And you didn't hear all my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now, still I miss you somehow

CHORUS:
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was youuuuuuuu
From the bottom of my broken heart

 Baby,  I said,  please stay .
Give our love a chance for one more day
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what my love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

CHORUS

You promised yourself, but to somebody else,
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

CHORUS

 Never look back,  we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so

2000,78,Crash and Burn,Savage Garden,,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

And there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breath again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

2000,79,Yes!,Chad Brock,Country,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Ohhhh how we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Ohhhh then I asked her can I see you again
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I wanna be
She's the one I long for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Ohhh then it happened one night looking in her eyes
Ohhh when I popped the question much to my sur-prize
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
So we called a preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since?
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

2000,81,Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,R&b,"I said I left my babygirl a message
Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cuz I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her 
But I need some time to be alone

1 -    But when you love someone
    You just don't treat them bad
    Oh how I feel so sad
    Now that I wanna leave
    She's crying her heart to me
    How could you let this be?
    I just need time to see
    Where I wanna be
    Where I wanna be

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby, oh no no

Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone
But I have to find what life is like
Without you

Repeat 1

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby

2 -    Say when you love someone
    You just don't treat them bad
    Oh how I feel so sad

2000,82,How Do You Like Me Now?!,Toby Keith,Country,"I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote ""call for a good time""

I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud.

How do you like me now
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

When I took off to Tennessee 
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Aint it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and tore them apart.

He never comes home 
And youre always alone
And your kids hear you cryin down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin
Who could that be singin
Its me baby, with your wake up call!

How do you like me now
How do you like me now,
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one

You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me

Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin',

Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

And that road rolls out like a welcome mat

We always said someday somehow
We were gonna get away gonna blow this town

Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talkin' about
What about now, why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line

2000,95,Cowboy Take Me Away,Dixie Chicks,Country,"I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly

I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars

Oh it sounds good to me I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall

I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile

Oh it sounds good to me
Yes it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

2000,98,Gotta Tell You,Samantha Mumba,Dance-pop,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   

Your love for me came as a waterfall   
Flowing inside me like never before   
Your love for me, something I didn't see   
But baby, I know better now   
When you walked in the room that very night   
A special feeling just burst inside   
It was only you, nobody else   
But baby, I know better now   

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me   
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too   
Don't wanna tell you this now   
Didn't tell you this tonight   

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   

And now you're back inside my house again   
I'm trying deeply to explain   
'Cos baby, I wanna get it on   
And now that I have got you all alone   
After all this talking on the phone   
I should be strong   
There's nothing wrong   

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me   
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too   
Don't wanna tell you this now   
Didn't tell you this tonight   
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too   
Don't wanna tell you this now   
Didn't tell you this tonight   

It was just something in your eyes   
That made me realise   
Now I hear voices deep inside   
Telling me, telling me it's you and I   

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me   
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too   
Don't wanna tell you this now

2000,99,Waiting for Tonight,Jennifer Lopez,Dance-pop,"Music and Lyrics: Maria Christiansen, Michael Garvin, Phil Temple

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
Have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

CHORUS: 
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh 
I've dreamed of this love for so long 
Waiting for tonight 
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning 
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on


Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

CHORUS

It sure is hot out here

Ya know

I don't mind thought

Just glad to be great

Know what I'm saying, uh!


Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you


I just wanna praise you


You broke the chains now I can lift my hands


And I'm gonna praise you


I'm gonna praise you


In the corners of mind

I just can't seem to find a reason to believe

That I can break free

Cause you see I have been down for so long

Feel like the hope is gone

But as I lift my hands, I understand

That I should praise you through my circumstance


Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you

I just wanna praise you

You broke the chains now I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you

I'm gonna praise you


Everything that could go wrong

All went wrong at one time

So much pressure fell on me

I thought I was gon lose my mind

But I know you wanna see

If I will hold on through these trials

But I need you to lift this load

Cause I can't take it anymore


Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you

I just wanna praise you

You broke the chains now I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you

I'm gonna praise you


Been through the fire and the rain

Bound in every kind of way

But God has broken every chain

So let me go right now


Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you

I just wanna praise you

You broke the chains now I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you

I'm gonna praise you



Take them off

What'cha gonna do, yeah


Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you

I just wanna praise you

You broke the chains now I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you

I'm gonna praise you

2001,4,Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me),Train,,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

It's like their all the same 
My appetite for lovin' 
Is now my hunger pain 

And when I'm feelin' sexy 
Who's gonna come for me 
My only problem is 
Their insecurity

But it was our time, even if it was part-time

But not knowin', ever growin' and we're gettin' married

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin
Expressway, hair back, weavin through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you aint gizell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I aint goin nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You aint a ganster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now while you grittin your teeth
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take alot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes


Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
'Dancin much, get it all now I'm complete, uh huh
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double R, can't crawl
Beware, cuz I crush anything I land on
Me here, aint no mistake nigga it was planned on

the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all

So I went
To Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cash box rang I thought everything away

There goes the dreams we used to say 
There goes the time we spent away
There goes the love I had but you cheated on me
And thats worth that now
There goes the house we made a home
There goes you'll never leave me alone
For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

Hey Ladies
When your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and Hit 'Em Up Style
Put your hands on his cash
And spend it to the last dime 
For all the hard times
Oh
When you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he messed up you gotta hit em up

While he was braggin
I was coming down the hill and just draggin
All his pictures and his clothes in the bag and
Sold everything else till there was just nothin left

And I paid
All the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fades away, away

There goes the dreams we used to say 
There goes the time we spent away
There goes the love I had but you cheated on me
And thats worth that now
There goes the house we made a home
There goes you'll never leave me alone

So you better let him know that
If he messed up you gotta hit em up


All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
Cuz a marriage is better than money you see

Hey Ladies

2001,12,It Wasn't Me,Shaggy,,"

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way


She said our dealy was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix 
Whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein is believin so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Wait for your answer: go over there 
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast


She said our dealy was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry 
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin to your reasonin
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Since I could call you 
But everything I can't 
remember as fucked up as it 
all may seem the consequences 
that I've rendered I've stretched 
myself beyond my means 

It's been awhile 
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted 
Since I could say I love myself as well 
Since I've gone and fucked things 
up just like I always do 
But all that shit seems to 
disappear when I'm with you 
But everything I can't remember 
as fucked up as it may seem 
The consequences that I've rendered, 
I've gone and fucked things up again. 
Why must I feel this way 
Just make this go away, 
Just one more peaceful day 

It's been awhile 
Since I could look at myself straight 
Since I said I'm sorry 
Since I've seen the way 
the candle lights your face 
But I can still remember 
just the way you taste 
But everything I can't remember as 
fucked up as it all may seem to be 
I know it's me I cannot blame this on my 
father he did the best he could for me 

It's been awhile 
Since I could hold my head up high 
and it's been awhile since I said 
I'm sorry

2001,15,U Remind Me,Usher,R&b,"Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen.

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try,
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

Thought that she was the one for me,
Til I found out she was on her dream,
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
This is why we could never be.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

I know it's so unfair to you,
But I'd be lingering the rest to you,
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.

Don't matter what you wear, all that matters is who you with

time.

Both eyes close, both arms froze, both charms rolls, with the S O S O D E dot F
Buyin' bottles bottles, until there ain't none left

Dont ignore the signs, thats right. 
You be her teacher,, taking. 


Shivering she awakes in the cold sweat 
terrified so she speaks under her breathe, 
makes a fake cry for help, shes a real mess, 
thats the sign of the stress, 
ma, listen to her 
heartbeats working overtime in her chest, 
scared stiff from approaching footsteps, 
ignoring the stains on her torn dress, 
come now ma, listen to her 


How could you put your own child in danger, 
and turn around and take the words of a stranger, 
you didnt wanna face the facts so you blamed her, 
too late ma, you should have listend to her 


Gone, shes asleep, finally, shes at peace, the angels, gone, out of reach, finally, soon to meet, the angels. 


Shes fading like a delicate flower, 
try to wash away the shame in the shower, 
defending him left her feeling overpowered, 
you were wrong ma, you didnt listen to her, 
it was there in the words of a letter, 
have you read that maybe things could be better, 
you let her down and I wont let you forget her, 
save ya tears ma, you should have listened to her

2001,18,Ride wit Me,Nelly,,"
If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
We three-wheelin in the fo' with the gold D's

If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home 
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on 
I peep something comin towards me up the dance floor 
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no
Her measurements were 36-25-34
Yellin I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there


Face and body front and back, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers or boozers she's bringin nuttin back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
when the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that, 4.6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, everytime I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin a livin off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Runnin credit checks with no shame now
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B.
Tellin me about a party up in NYC
Can I make it Damn right, I be on the next flight
Payin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White


Check, check -- yo, I know somethin you don't know
And I got somethin to tell ya
You won't believe how many people, straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers askin me fo' dough
And I'm yellin, ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show""

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggaz wanna know why, why I fly by
But yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be no stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz
Poppin like we drug dealers, sippin Crissy, bubb' mackin
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, tellin me to leave wit you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knockin to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rockin to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we poppin the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggaz starin or they diss
Honies lookin all they wish - come on boo, gimme kiss

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there

Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive, oh oh

No matter who's that man that walk out of your life

You don't need 'em, don't be no heater

Long as I'm still breathin, not leavin for no reason

See them come and go, one switch, they not gold

No house no mo', not even a condo

As long as I know how to love, I'ma stay alive

No need your game or style

They can't tame me cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin down

Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit

and in my game, no doubt, I'ma get paid in a big way, survivor!

    Think I wanna drive your Benz 
    I don't 
    If I wanna floss I got my own 
    Even if you were broke 
    My love don't cost a thing 

When you rolled up in the Escalade 
Saw that truck you gave to the valet 
Knew that it was game when you looked at me 
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling 
Saw you later in the corner booth 
Raising up a toast so I would notice you 
But your heart's a mess 
Think you outta know 
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

    That you treat me right 
    Give me all the things I need 
    That money can't buy yeah

When I took a chance 
Thought you'd understand 
Baby credit cards aren't romance 
So you're tryna buy what's already yours 
What I need from is not available in stores 
Seen a side of you that I really feel 
Doing way too much, never keep it real 
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road 
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? 
I've got to go

Can substitute the time you take 
Take the keys here to my heart 
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart 
I think you need to take some time 
To show me that your love is true 
There's more than dollar signs in you 
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel 
With your arms around me 
I only wish that you could see

And we rock the beat
26, Bad Boy baby
Remix

Pullin' petals off a flower, tryna get your way
Keep pullin' 'til it tells what you wanna say
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby

I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking
You'll be giving him an open invitation
But my baby won't be takin' it, no

Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss
You can flirt your pretty eyes
Cuz he ain't got his hands tied

So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not

No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not

I can see clearly now

You're the kind of girl that's always up for do or dare
Only want him because he's there
Always lookin' for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side

You're the kind of girl who's not used to hearin' no
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go
Doesn't matter how hard you try
You're never gonna get with my guy


And wind up with the breakfast and head
You know it ain't no rest
I love you like Kung Fu and new ones
I ain't got time for hotlines
Oh contrare, I won't flare
Catch me on Con Air, causin' a bomb scare
So much cream, my thumb green
A million scene reminds me of a dream

Sugar.baby

Such a sexy,sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring 
and I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing I'm asking could this be real
Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough I was lost Now I'm found 
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want 
So yo, I'm putting it down.

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message 
to show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
To tell truth, I really never knew 
T'll I met you I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it

My lifestyle's wild I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
And yo. what' s happening now 
I see the sun breaking shining through dark clouds 
and a vision of you standing out in a crowd.

Come come my lady

So sexy....almost evil Talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read but 
you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase 
and as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss 
and a thank you miss.

2001,30,Put It on Me,Ja Rule,East coast hip hop,"Where would I be without my baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
When you cry who wipes your tears
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin to fear
Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me


Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy put it on me


Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
Cuz you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me

2001,32,I Hope You Dance,Lee Ann Womack,Country pop,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
GOD forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance.

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin',
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone.)

2001,37,Fill Me In,Craig David,2-step garage,"
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor

So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Chucked in where nobody saw

The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it coz you felt cold

I'm not being mean
I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in


All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby


Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby

Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in


Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Cuz I want it all
Or nothing at all

When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call 
You leave me here with nothing at all

There are time it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it , show it
Then there's times you look at me
As thought I'm all that you could see
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it , know it

Don't make me promises baby you never did know how to keep them well

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true


It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me
Each and every single day I know 
I'm going to have to eventually give you away

And though my love is true

To the dark side of the moon

Something to do with you

As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side 
With my superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times 
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, 
If not for me then you would be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still

Check this out

You say you love me.
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different
Tell me if you, were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me
Would you trust me

But you feedin' me, All this rap about, 
How it's different 
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about, 
You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

You're creepin' on him for me,
But you say just trust me.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
Till you find out it's harder
And I'm pretty sure,
That he's thinkin'
That you're totally his, but you're here in my room
Don't cha'll talk wit me
All hugged up,
And all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be
Don't want this
To happen to me.
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me.



Don't tell him baby
You won't do this shit to me

Baby tell me one thing
How could you do it
What did he do to you
Does he know he blew it

Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason

I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him

If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cuz tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me
You would do it to me

And I don't want no minute man, and that's real

No regards, close but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin, so get your head right
It's all in yo' mind punk so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs

They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit
Just cause I'm an ALL-nighter, shoot ALL fire

Ooooooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man

Ooooooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got..

2001,61,Never Had a Dream Come True,S Club 7,,"Everybody's got something they had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back or wondering
How it could be now or might have been
Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you know

I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time
And so my road can never be cos yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use looking back or wondering
How it could be now or might have been
Oh this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go

I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will, you know you will
Oh baby, you'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use looking back or wondering
Because love is a strange and funny thing
No matter how I try and try I just can't say goodbye
No no no no

I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
You're the one I think about each day

Ladies and gentleman 
You've got the fine ass Tamia in the house tonight 
She just came from off tour 
She got a little story she wants y'all to hear, remix 

I don't understand 
You look just like my man 
In the picture, heh sitting by my bed 
The suspense is pounding and it's clouding up my head 
I'm checkin' your clothes 
And you wear the same size shoe 
But I don't know just who you are 

1 - There's a stranger in my house 
    Took a while to figure out 
    There's no way you could be who you say you are 
    You gotta be someone else 
    Cause he wouldn't touch me like that 
    And he wouldn't treat me like you do 
    He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me 
    So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house 

I'm not sure who you are 
Don't see your shadow around when you walk, no 
You leave with no kisses 
Goodbye with no words 
If these walls could talk 
They would have nothing to tell 

So what could it be? 
Is there someone immitating me? 
Could she be taking my place? 
Look me in the face 
And tell me that I'm wrong when I say... 

Repeat 1 

Pop quiz 
Tell me where we first kissed 
Tell me where my spot is 
Tell me if I liked it, loved it 
Or could it be 
That the stranger is me 
Have I changed so drastically? 
Is it I want more for me? 
And you remain the same 

If the beat stop rockin' 
The Def will keep rockin' 
If the beat stop rockin' 
The Def will keep rockin' 
If the Def stop rockin' 
The kids will keep rockin' 
If the beat stop rockin' 
The Def will keep rockin' 
Yeah you know how I do 
Tamia, the remix, yeah 
Uh-huh, oh sing-a-long y'all

Sing for me

You know
I don't know what it is
But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't nobody want it
I got 10K on it, I'm the hottest thing out
If you look at me, you're lookin' at a kid with a plan
If you don't understand homie, check soundscan
So So Def to grain
You know our motto
In the street throwin' paper like we just won the lotto
Guest on the beat, like dubs hit on the six
Irresistible to all chicks
Listen to the remix

Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I'm meant to say no

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Oh I can hardly breathe, yeah
Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
Cause when I feel his arms hooked around me

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Think you know
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
He's so irresistable
{Like that, oh}

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

2001,64,Heard It All Before,Sunshine Anderson,R&b,"Baby let me explain to you I'm sayin
what you sayin
It's not even like that
It wasn't like that but I saw you
Baby I don't love her
You don't love me
you know what I don't even want to talk to you
she don't mean nothing to me 
I don't want to see ya face
I just want to see you walking thourgh that door
there ain't nothing else to say 
peace

Come home late 
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
If you want some loving I suggest you go back there where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you 
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I .....

All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk 
Baby this, Baby that
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
I was your fool I believed in you 
Yes I did yes I did
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now

WHat were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do 
And there's nothing you can say 
That would persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out 
I am no longer concerned
See I......

Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think, that's what you said to me
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
You got a good game I must admit I was it but it's over
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now

Use to hang on to your every word
but the more you lie to me the more I hurt
the things you use to say would sound so sweet
I was naive Quick to believe

Heard it all before 
I was at work, It wasn't my car you saw, baby, I swear it wasn't me
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
you were my boo I trusted you for way too long
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now

Heard it all before 
you know you messed up you got to know you messed up 
You got to go now say what you want
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now
Played the fool before 
I done change the locks on the door, yes i did and you ain't welcome no more
But your lies ain't working now look who's hurting now

See I heard it all before

2001,65,The Space Between,Dave Matthews Band,Alternative rock,"You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you, love

The Space Between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What wild-eyed beast you be
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain

Will I hold you again
Will I hold...

Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil
In a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The Space Between
Where you're smiling high
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The Space Between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into...
The Space Between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Love is all we need here

The Space Between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The Space Between
Your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time
The Space Between...

Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down 
till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some


I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, I can see, why can't you see it's all in me


Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need
Follow me down, follow me down down down, 
I do not need I do not need nobody
Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need

2001,71,Ain't Nothing 'bout You,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"Once I thought that love was something I could never do 
Never knew that I could feel this much 
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you 
Is more than a reaction to your touch 
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough 

The way you look, the way you laugh, 
The way you love with all you have, 
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me 
The way you kiss, The way you cry, 
The way you move when you walk by 
That don't do something for me 

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows 
That never knocked me off my feet 
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go 
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender 
Girl you got everything 

The way you look, the way you laugh, 
The way you love with all you have, 
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me 
The way you kiss, The way you cry, 
The way you move when you walk by 
That don't do something for me 

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought 
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on 

The way you look, the way you laugh, 
The way you love with all you have, 
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me 
The way you kiss, The way you cry, 
The way you move when you walk by 
That don't do something for me 

The way you look, the way you laugh, 
The way you love with all you have, 
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive 

The way you talk, the way you tease 
Right now I think you see 
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

When it stops better press rewind
Let me hear it

From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time

Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already
There

2001,75,Beautiful Day,U2,Rock,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination

You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day

2001,76,Austin,Blake Shelton,Country,"She left without leavin' a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind 
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time 
It was almost a year before she called him up 
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got 

If you're callin' 'bout the car I sold it 
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling 
If you've got somethin' to sell, you're wastin' your time, I'm not buyin' 
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone, 
You know what to do 
And P.S. if this is Austin, I still love you 

The telephone fell to the counter 
She heard but she couldn't believe 
What kind of man would hang on that long 
What kind of love that must be 
She waited three days, and then she tried again 
She didn't know what she'd say, 
But she heard three rings and then 

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame 
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain 
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone, all weekend long 
But I'll call you back when I get home 
On Sunday afternoon 
And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you 

Well, this time she left her number 
But not another word 
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evenin' 
And this is what he heard 

If you're callin' 'bout my heart 
It's still yours 
I should've listened to it a little more 
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong 
And by the way, boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to 
Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you 

I still love you

And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother 
Like ice cream melting they embraced 
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face 
All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard 
And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car 
I wanted to tell him it would be ok 
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away 

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 

Keep having this dream about my old man 
I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand 
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down 
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around 
So many things I wanna say to him 
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind 

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry 

I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife 
And everything that I hold dear in my life 
We say grace and thank the Lord 
Got so much to be thankful for 
Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says 
""I haven't had my story yet."" 

And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that 
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, 
""I Love You Dad"" 

I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry 
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And got all these hoes, givin' it up
I like a little Rule baby, how cute are you
With a body that rides all sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, and I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch
Rule bitch, not givin' a fuck

Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'

Picked up my ride and started crackin'

About a man comin' in 
Finding his woman in bed wit' 
Well, listen 

It's 2 a.m., just getting in 
About to check my message 
No one has called but my homies 
And some bill collectors 
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money 
I two-way her, she don't hit me back 
Something is funny 

So I called her mother's house 
And asked her, had she seen my baby 
Drove my 6 around looking for that missing lady 
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news 
And I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused 

And then I turned the TV down 
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound 
Umm, something's going on upstairs, yeah 
Cuz I know nobody else lives here 

As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear 
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear 
Screaming out 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 

I ran downstairs, looked in the closet 
Looking for that, ooh 
Said a prayer, cause only God knows what I'm gonna do 
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild 
I'm in the hall contemplating, not in my own damn house 
Who would of thought she was creeping with another man 
The down low happening to me all over again 

And then I turned the TV down 
Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound 
Something going on up there, upstairs 
Cuz I know ain't no one else lives here 

As I get closer to the stairways all I hear 
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear 
Screaming

		Before you start to point your cane 
		How did I get into this 
		Shoulda never came home with this bitch 
		Back to where you come from 
		Hit the streets, yo' ass is grass 
		Hmm, now don't I know you 
		From somewhere a long time ago

And all the little days and party joints we'd do

If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house  
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits  
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em

But y'all don't wanna raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down

And how I used to club hop on weekends  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolensces

Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hurst  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good? 

It's been fifteen years since I left home
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Give it my best and then I left it alone
Oh I hope they're doin' alright
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord, I guess he's doin' alright 

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?Sometimes its lonely
Sometimes its only me and 
The shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin' 
Howlin' at the moon

Well I might go get me a new tatoo or
Take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good? 

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

2001,91,You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This,Toby Keith,Country,"I've got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do maybe kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this

If you do baby kiss me again
Kiss me again

Now everything-everything-everything is all right   
Get over yourself-know why   
Cause without you see I do anything I like  
Sometimes I stay out all night   
And everything -everything-everything is all right   

This just can't be it I kept telling myself   
And every magazine said was me was on the shelf

Here I am, you know it's me 
The focused-out brotha with the pinky ring 
People stare, women scream 
Cuz they never seen a brotha be so clean 
Gangstah hats, minks to match 
Glass half full just sippin now 
Big Snoop Dogg bout to fuck you up 
Me and Outkast just lay in the back 
In the Cadillac, grill intact 
Purple-blue gators, and belts to match 

Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane 
Too much of data can make the mind overload 
Scramble all logic not even you can decode 
It doesnt matter just shut the fuck up and ride 
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh so clean 
rimp rimp rimp 


I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin in the worst way 
Never come in last place, usually come in first place 
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me 
Kick me some brandi, keg me and lace me 
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin at 
a P-I-M-P, and wing-tip Stacey's 
Lately, hate me, is all that they could triple with 
Know them niggas best to hit, that I'm the ones to kick it with 
Runnin high, tell a lie, watch the P I stay outside 
O-U-T-hills now, dirty see I still slide 
The bitches love the way we ride 
So if you aint a big dogg, then I suggest you stay in cells now

You cant sell me, tell me silly gilly hilly billy

To the window's to the wall's, to the bathroom nigga dont fall 
The cast gone keep on bumpin and dumpin, to post up on all of y'all 
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, L-B-C 
College Park, E-P-T, on the remix tip we gon' sit 
On the rim tip and wing tip, like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp 
Manifacturing in a fashion, mashin might be stabbin 
You crabbin, your girl is stabbin and frabbin I'm snappin and trappin 
Deba, depana, dashin, all I need is a congac, and a cold coca-cola 
Slashin, smooth serious smashin, multi-rubels matching

I'm draftin 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows I know!
And I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows
And break it down low to the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow
And everytime I +Busta Rhyme+, baby ""Gimme Some Mo'""
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind
And I'll be right back; yeah that's my very next line
I use it - time after time, when I'm speakin my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, ""Who dat is, talkin that shit about the 'tics""
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin shit like this
Should we apologize Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, HEY!

If you ain't bout money then best be gone, nigga
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me

In the black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin smells amaz-on

Another one pag-in, tellin me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From +Phat Farm+ to +Iceberg Slim+ in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit the P hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room cause she used the word ours, HEY!


Aiyyo I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin icky
Let go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin when the shows out - whatchu mean!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut - come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut - is you wit me
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut
Then I slide up in the Escalade
Me and E gettin solid like the Ice Capades
And me and Heezy - frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies
If you compare me to your local grocery
Then you'll see I got more carrots/karats than ""Aisle D""
More bread than ""Aisle G"", then bag and scan me
+Sure+ like +Al B.+, meet the 'tics in Maui, HEY!

2001,96,Be Like That,3 Doors Down,,"He spends his nights in California, 
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders, 
Why can't that be me
Cause in his life he is filled
With all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things 
He'd rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight, 
He looks up with a little smile at me,
And he says,
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
Now and dreams we run
She spends her days up in the north park,
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just
A little piece of this dream, 
Is that too much to ask
With a safe home, and a warm bed, 
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to
Hold onto, that's all she needs
Yeah!
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
I'm falling into this, dreams
We run away
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do

2001,97,Most Girls,Pink,R&b,"I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, gettin paid was everything
But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

MOST GIRLS want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
MOST GIRLS want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no

And I don't need no G to take care of me, no

Cuz I'm not most girls, don't wanna dance if he can't be everything
I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of

Was it something you left behind 
Don't you remember anything I said when I said, 

Don't fall away and leave me to myself 
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
And leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands 
Love lies bleeding 

Oh hold me now I feel contagious 
Am I the only place that you've left to go 
She cries her life is like 
Some movie in black and white 
Dead actors faking lines, over and over and over again she cries 


And I watched as you turned away 
You don't remember, but I do 
You never even tried 

Don't fall away and leave me to myself 
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again, oh

No more broken heart for me

Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
No more waiting late up at night
No more havin' to fuzz and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin' about what you do
There's no more of me runnin' back to you

Let me lick you from yo neck to yo back
Then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian, trips to the Carribean
But tonight, no ends

While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leaving you tonight 

See my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more,
I can't keep running back to you

2002,5,Wherever You Will Go,The Calling,Post-grunge,"So lately, I've been wonderin
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave should fall
It would fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
The way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave should fall
It would fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you


Runaway with my heart
Runaway with my hope
Runaway with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart and your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time


If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go

2002,6,A Thousand Miles,Vanessa Carlton,Pop,"Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way

And I miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever 
Think of me

'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your
Precious memories

'Cause I need you
And I miss you

2002,7,In the End,Linkin Park,Nu metal,"One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past - you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then baby...

Hang up and you call right back

It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
Flowers, cards and candy
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

See I've been there, done it, fucked around

Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad...hey

And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild


Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare


Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair



Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine

I need a girl that'll ride for me
Situation get real bitch'll die for me
Even step in the courtroom and lie for me
I'm talkin' about right hand in the sky for me
Do twenty-five for me, nigga steal a pound for me
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me
And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me
Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas that diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need  
The type smoke all a nigga's weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed


I had a girl that woulda died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild
Now these's days that I reminisce
But long as you happy I'ma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix
Mamacita


Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low
I'ma tell you how it really be
'Cuz I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale

And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do

I'm talkin' about right hand in the sky for me
Do twenty-five for me, nigga steal a pound for me
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me
And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me
Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas that diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need  
The type smoke all a nigga's weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed


I had a girl that woulda died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild
Now these's days that I reminisce
But long as you happy I'ma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix
Mamacita


Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low
I'ma tell you how it really be
'Cuz I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale
Cause all I wanna do is take care of you
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you
You feel me girl

It's been awhile, where should we begin
Feels like forever
Within my heart a memory 
A perfect love that you gave to me 
Oh, I remember 

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My Sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to realize 
What's in yourself and within your mind 
Let's find peace there

2002,21,Without Me,Eminem,Comedy hip hop,"""Obie Trice/Real Name No Gimmicks""

2 trailer park girls go round me outside
round me outside, round me outside

Guess whos back, back again
Shadys back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back
Guess who's back...

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
see Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver
well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker then a
shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
when I'm rocking the table while he's operating
you waited this long now stop debating cuz I'm back,
I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney but your husbands heart problem's complicating
So the FCC wont let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips fuck that,
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck
YOU DEBBIE_!

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
cuz we need a little controversy,
cuz it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
they start feeling the prisoners helpless,
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution, pollutin the air waves a rebel
so let me just revel an bask, in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please"" feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me


A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit.
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards, and Moby
you can get stomped by Obie, you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old let go its over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since
Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting, but its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly
there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me

Love would all save us

Look what love gave us

A world full of killing
And blood spilling
That world never came

Afraid to feel
I just hit the floor
Don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling
And there's no reason
Let's make the call
And take it all again
Woah again

Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

Well this is not for real
Afraid to feel
I just hit the floor
Don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling
And there's no reason
Let's make the call
And take it all

I'm wasting my time again

Lonesome, lonely
See you waiting
I see you waiting

And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
That maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out heaven save me
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
That maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's somthing left for me
So please come stay with me

For you and me 
For you and me

To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Le do le le le le, Le do le le le le

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near

We can always play by ear
But that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river 

Le do le le le le, Le do le le le le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever

The one to show you where you are

Ahh... you make my heart sing
Girl you should be my girlfriend...

2002,35,Soak Up the Sun,Sheryl Crow,,"Out on the hills of glory land
So happy and free at God's right hand
They tell of a place of marvelous grace
On Heaven's bright shore
Pilgrims on earth some day will go
To live in that home for evermore
Trusting in Him who died for sin
And rose from the grave
Not even a tear will dim the eye
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
When I must cross that rolling tide
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land
Made perfect by love
When I walk up that milky white way
I'll see that home coming in array
How great it must be for Angels to see
A pilgrim reach home
"
2002,36,Don't Let Me Get Me,Pink,Pop,"I never win 1st place
I don't support the team
I can't take direction
And my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me
My parents hated me
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothing right

Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
Can't take the person staring back at me

I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't want to be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

LA told me
You'll be a pop star
All you have to change
Is everything you are
Tired of being compared
To damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty
That just ain't me

So doctor doctor won't you please prescribe me something
A day in the life of someone else

What you tryin to do?



Yo, yo, yo...

Yo N-O-R papi, say what? That nigga's the man

Still flossin', showin your rocks

Ain't you dudes heard ""Grimey"" man we stoled your watch

It goes indian style, knees bent in dashiki

Strapped with the veritek baby tec B.T.

True she at the bar lookin good in the brown dress

Four to six shots and them things ain't around yet

Persona all thugged out loud and clear

Sayin fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer

You see I'm reppin now, and my mami's I got a weapon now

Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin now

Left that wack label cause I don't like pricks

I'm like a hammer that you hold on your hand, I make hits

At the white boy club while I'm buyin the bar

They like, ""Hey now, you're an all star,"" it go



I spit mack millimeter rhymes, kill a liter in line

My nigga Peter got a heater of mines

Niggaz still lyin, in they wack ass bars

Only time they seen jail, when they watchin ""Oz""

I'm in the club pissy drunk like, ""Ahhhdadidaaaaa!!!!""

And mami took it proper like, ""Dadadidaaaaa!!!!!""

Adios kill your soul, then we body your ghost

They call me gordo, I sip the champagne that's importo


I like when chocha be nappy too

I treat life like a fast car, lower my speed

I try and chill, and sell more records than Creed


A criminal, don't leave no prints

These dudes gave me a brick and they ain't seen me since

Caught up wit'em, had them dudes straight hoppin the fence, it go





Yo, yo, yo...

Yo oops, I done it again, I got another one

I keep it hid in my pocket I got another one

""Fast and Furious"", dunn dunn dunn tudunn

Still be in, Miami and jet skiing

In the ocean where the sharks be at, just O.D.'n

Adebesi, want a brick you pay double easy

I got them things that'll move easy

And I told the lawyer, I sold blow to old Goya

I'm half spanish, you see I cook coke for Goya

I'm haf spanish, all day arroz con polla

Recognize, whem I'm runnin the game, before me

Chickens wasn't even messin with brain, because me

Now you started gettin head on the westside highway

So recognize my nigga you did it my way

Ice rockin, brick choppin and gun shoppin

I did it all beat cases without Cochran

It was all meant to be
Would you believe me,
Would you agree
It's almost that feelin'
That we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come and now...

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime,
For a moment like this
Some people search forever,
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime,
For a moment like this

Everything changes
But beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well I maybe dreamin'
But 'till I awake
Can we make this dream last forever
And I'll cherish all the love we share

For a moment like this
Some people search forever,
For that one special kiss

I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this...

We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages

2002,42,No Such Thing,John Mayer,Pop rock,"""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
"
2002,43,Just Like a Pill,Pink,Pop rock,"Lying here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I'll think I'll get out of here

Where I can run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears

And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill


I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
It must be a bad trip
All of the other pills were different

Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I'll think I'll get out of here

Where I can run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears


And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

2002,44,Down 4 U,Ja Rule,Hip hop,"U puttin' it on me? You must be

Yo, this is no intention
To being offensive to women
By calling y'all bitches
My down ass bitches
Still, my queen bitches
Cuts look clean on the finger
Next to that finger you flipped at me
And there's no in between me and you
Only me and you
Who else gon put it on ya like the Rule
And God only looks after children and fools
And you're not so who gon' look after you?
Rule baby

True baby, it's only for you baby
Vita's thighs only divide if you inside
Cuz I love the way you touch me
Nobody can get it
And if it's comin or gunnin
Just considered it's spitted
So when you gone for a minute
I just fantasize
Like if it's you that's all in it
Then I'm satisfied til you come back to me
Holdin' stacks and jewels
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-A Rule Baby


I'm gonna be here when you need me
Rule baby, can always count on me
And you don't ever have to worry
You know I'll make it in a hurry
Here for you and I will never leave
Shed tears fou you, cuz boy, you got to me
There will never be another for me
You'll always be my one and only


Yea, let's get it gwenin' like we Ashford and Simpson
Or Ike and Anna Mae on one of they good days
You smile like smile rays 5'5 with brown eyes and thick legs
Only for the Rule baby


Now baby, I told you I can show you
Better than I can tell you
Blow trial, bring commissaries and mail
You them sweet words and naked force
I'm still that pretty down down ass 2 cars behind your 6
And not just any clown ass
Glockin my round ass only a down ass
And it's all for you
I grown a tad bit
Since we been at it like rabbits
The booty lil plumper and it's...


Shit, who gon love you like that?
Thug with you with it stacked to the ceiling
Or splittin a dub with you
Cuz I play my position with cold D's and O.G.'s
Until that blood shed, blood red, or we OD'd
Remember every word that you told me?

Show me, hold me

All you need in your life is Chuck, drugs, and dubs
And 22's now tell me who the honey for you?

More than some pretty face beside a train

Fall upon my knees

About a home I'll never see

With clouds between their knees

Only a man in a funny red sheet  
Looking for special things inside of me

2002,47,Cleanin' Out My Closet,Eminem,Hardcore hip hop,"Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...


I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...


Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothings the same

I'd hate walk away from you as if this never existed
Cause when we kissed the moment after I looked at you different
Lately I gotta watch what I say
Cause you take things personally nowadays 
You used to laugh now you get mad
Damn I just want my friend back

When it breaks
All it takes is some trying

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna make you stay
Soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past so fast
It was good, it was bad but it was real 
And that's all you get in the end of the matter

All it takes is some trying
You can run, you can hide

2002,63,Lose Yourself,Eminem,Hip hop,"Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip 

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Is he No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da


No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another jam or not 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

You can, go if you want

I don't, need you pity

I will, be just fine

If you decide, that you want to leave

Close the, door behind you

I just, want to know what...


What about all of the

Things that you say

What about all of the

Promises that you made

What about all of the

Nights that you gave

What about all of the

Things you told me

What about, what about

What about us What about us, us

What about us What about us, us


I thought you said you were different

Was that what I heard you say

Said that you'd love only me


What happened to promises

Said that you were a better man

Your words have no way with me

Cause you're counterfeit, I see


I don't need this bullshit

I won't put up with it, any longer

You can, go if you want

I don't, need you pity

I will, be just fine

If you decide, that you want to leave

Close the, door behind you

I just, want to know what...

Promises that you made

What about all of the

Nights that you gave

What about, what about

What about us What about us, us

What about us What about us, us


Baby you should now hear this...

Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with

Now what if I told you you're game was played, I licked it

Yo what if I said I wasn't true, so do you

You and I know, without me there's no you

So what about the bills that were passed due

Before you, all you said to me was ""Baby I'll owe you""

Forget about the brand new life that I gave you

Now what about us to me, now what about us to me


What about all of the

Things that you say

What about all of the

Promises that you made

What about all of the

Nights that you gave

What about all of the

Things you told me

2002,66,Underneath Your Clothes,Shakira,Rock,"You're a song 
Written by the hands of god
Don't get me wrong cause 
This might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them 
Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

Because of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over 
We will still belong to each other 

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true 
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the celing
Like a lady to her good manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath Your Clothes
There's an endless story 
There's the man I chose 
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey

2002,68,Differences,Ginuwine,R&b,"
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gon' do it to me
I need to tell you something
Check this out

You say you love me.
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different
Tell me if you, were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me
Would you trust me

But you feedin' me, All this rap about, 
How it's different 
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about, 
You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

You're creepin' on him for me,
But you say just trust me.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
Till you find out it's harder
And I'm pretty sure,
That he's thinkin'
That you're totally his, but you're here in my room
Don't cha'll talk wit me
All hugged up,
And all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be
Don't want this
To happen to me.
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me.



Don't tell him baby
You won't do this shit to me

Baby tell me one thing
How could you do it
What did he do to you
Does he know he blew it

Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason

I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him

If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cuz tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me
You would do it to me

2002,69,If I Could Go!,Angie Martinez,,"{Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!

If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy

And a seat, know why the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

Go 'head

Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo

Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

And the shop's there

If they don't got em, they don't make em

No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all

Okay, here we go 

Yeah I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog 
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sang alooooooong 
Sang aloooooooooong.. 
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day 
when it's rainin inside and you're, all alooooooooone 
All aloooooooooone - yeah! 

Cause the whole, world, loves it when you don't get down 
And the whole, world, loves it when you make that sound 
And the whole, world, loves it when you're in the news 
And the whole, world, loves it when you sang the blues 

Take a little trip, hater pack up yo' mind 
Look forward not behind, then you'll see what you find 
I caught a sucker dyin cause he thought could rhyme 
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime 
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts 
 I don't use abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither 
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather 
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever 
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage 
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage 
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you 
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do 
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all 
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it 
Throw a curl in it 
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it 
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote 
And this for dem niggaz workin at the airpo't 
who got laid off, I take my shades off 
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise 
Because the whole, whole, world, world 


Player I grind, my focus is crime 
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime 
My words are diamonds dug out a mine 
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine 
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss 
I catch a beat runnin like Randy Moss 
Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse 
I'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss 
Mami I'm comin I hope you get off 
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk 
Back, back, forth, forth 
Get that sailor on course, course 
Make that track a corpse, corpse 
Rap, roll, utterly rocked 
with my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock 
Cadillac OutKast just won't stop 


Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal 
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal 
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches 
like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate 
Wait, back to the enemy of the state 
is the Republicans or Democratic candidate 
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate 
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break 
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this 
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list 
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list 
When it come to this music we stay relentless 
Pursuing all that's pursuable 
Doing God's willing all things that are doable 
The only liable limitation is yourself 
Dre set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, cause

2002,71,Underneath It All,No Doubt,Reggae fusion,"There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're... 
You're something else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely 

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad 


So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better... better... 

You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps stalin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
That so many adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
You're good for me, baby
Oh that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be


You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lovely
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

2002,79,No More Drama,Mary J. Blige,R&b,"So tired, tired of these drama
No more, no more
I wanna be free
I'm so tired, so tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burn
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

Noone's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Nooone's gonna make me hurt again
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind

Uh, it feel so good
When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

No more, no more, No more, no more
No drama, no more in my life 

No more drama, no more drama
No more drama, no more drama
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA

NO MORE DRAMA
No more drama in my life

2002,82,The Good Stuff,Kenny Chesney,Country,"Well, me an' my lady had our first big fight,
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon light.
A corner bar, an it just seemed right.
So I pulled up.

Not a soul around but the old bar keep,
Down at the end an' looking half asleep.
An he walked up, an' said : ""What'll it be""
I said: ""The good stuff.""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer.
His blue eyes kinda went misty,
He said: ""You can't find that here.

""'Cos it's the first long kiss on a second date.
""Momma's all worried when you get home late.
""And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate,
""'Cos your hands are shakin' so much.
""An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair.
""Eatin' burtn suppers the whole first year
""An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up.
""Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.""

He grabbed a carton of milk an' her poured a glass.
An' I smiled an' said: ""I'll have some of that.""
We sat there an' talked as an hour passed,
Like old friends.

I saw a black an' white picture an' it caught my stare,
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair.
He said: ""That's my Bonnie,
""Taken 'bout a year after we were wed.""

He said ""Spent five years in the bar,
""When the cancer took her from me.
""But I've been sober three years now,
""'Cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:

""Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl.
""The way she adored that string of pearls,
""I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl,
""Married his high school love.""
""An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'.
""Bein' right there as our time got small,
""An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up,
""Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.""

He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry.
""When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I.'
""An' look into those eyes, so deep in love,
""An' drink it up.
""'Cos that's the good stuff.
""That's the good stuff.

2002,86,Drive (For Daddy Gene),Alan Jackson,Country,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine; put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood that will never be forgotten

It was just on old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, ""you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton shortbed ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With a three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it mode me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, ""a little slower son you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt rood with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, ""turn it left and steer it right,
Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine""
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When daddy let me drive

When daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

Daddy let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke

2002,87,Standing Still,Jewel,Folk-pop,"Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here
To the twilight
There's a dead end to my left
There's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

Do you want me
Like I want you
Or am I standing still
Beneath the darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you
Passing my by

Mother's on the stoop
Boys in souped up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm
I'm gonna drown
In this strange town
Feel broken down
I feel broken down 
Do you need me
Like I need you

Or am I standing still
Beneath the darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you
Passing my by

A sweet sorrow is
The call tomorrow
A sweet sorrow is
The call tomorrow

Do you love me
Like I love you

Or am I standing still
Beneath the darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner
Of my eye
Was that you
Passing me by

Are you passing me by
Passing me by
Do you want me
Passing me by

Do you need me
Like I need you too
And do you want me
Like I want you
Passing me by

After one conversation, this must be right



Move kid, get out the way with the bullshit, here comes Jose

It's a full moon out tonight the don is here

And everybody lookin like they don't belong in here

Where he come from why his hat so low

How he pop so many bottles he must have some dough

But probably look good it's shitty from the hood

If fair by the looks he must bought some bricks

What's love gotta do with a little menage

We could take it outside on the hood of the car

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has... come

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength

2002,92,Turn Off the Light,Nelly Furtado,,"It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down 
till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some


I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, I can see, why can't you see it's all in me


Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need
Follow me down, follow me down down down, 
I do not need I do not need nobody
Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need

A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to 
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
'Til you smiled with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you
There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else

2002,94,My List,Toby Keith,Country,"Under an old brass paperweight is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Pick up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've bot more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Pick up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Raise a little hell, laugh 'til it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
"
2002,95,Hands Clean,Alanis Morissette,,"If it weren't for your maturity none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention you wouldn't have been successful and
If it weren't for me you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're kind of my protege and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it

Ooh this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

what part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept
what part of your memory is selective and tends to forget 
what with this distance it seems so obvious

Just make sure you don't tell on me especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cuz you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might want to marry you one day if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh this could be messy and
Ooh I don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

2002,97,Long Time Gone,Dixie Chicks,Bluegrass,"Daddy sits on a' front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I've been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again


Now me, I went to Nashville,
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I'm gonna be a star

Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin'
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank 
I think, I think, I think

The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it's been a long time

Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone

Long time, long time, long time gone
Yeah yeah

2002,98,Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,Country,"Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day 
Out in the yard with your wife and children 
Working on some stage in LA 
Did you stand there in shock at the site of 
That black smoke rising against that blue sky 
Did you shout out in anger 
In fear for your neighbor 
Or did you just sit down and cry 

Did you weep for the children 
Who lost their dear loved ones 
And pray for the ones who don't know 
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble 
And sob for the ones left below 

Did you burst out in pride 
For the red white and blue 
The heroes who died just doing what they do 
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer 
And look at yourself to what really matters 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God 
And I remember this from when I was young 
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us 
And the greatest is love 

Where were you when the world stopped turning that September day 
Teaching a class full of innocent children 
Driving down some cold interstate 
Did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor 
In a crowded room did you feel alone 
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her 
Did you dust off that bible at home 
Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened 
Close your eyes and not go to sleep 
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages 
Speak with some stranger on the street 
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow 
Go out and buy you a gun 
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching 
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns 
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger 
Stand in line and give your own blood 
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family 
Thank God you had somebody to love 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God 
And I remember this from when I was young 
Faith hope and love are some good things he gave us 
And the greatest is love 

I'm just a singer of simple songs 
I'm not a real political man 
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you 
The difference in Iraq and Iran 
But I know Jesus and I talk to God

And the greatest is love 

The greatest is love

2002,99,Like I Love You,Justin Timberlake,R&b,"Just something about you...
Way I'm lookin at you whatever
You keep lookin at me...
You gettin scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny
It feel good right?...
Listen

I kind of noticed, from one night
From the club, your front face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change
If you smiling that should set the tone - just be limber
If you let go the music should groove your bones - just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

People are so phony
Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
Cause we're here tonight
If you smiling, that should set the tone - just be limber baby
If you let go, the music should groove your bones - baby just remember
Sing this song with me


Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl ...

Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids, ""that's how the chain glow""
Point to her they say, ""wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleepin in the same bed everynight

Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots let it burn in your chest
We could ride down pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number 3, joint called ""Brain""
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?



{*beat stops}

Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums {*beat resumes}
It's kind of special right? yeah...
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined 
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance...

2003,5,When I'm Gone,3 Doors Down,Post-grunge,"There's another world inside of me 
That you may never see
There's secrets in this life
That I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away...
Maybe I'm just blind...

Maybe I'm just blind...

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be
I'll never let you down
Even if I could 
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Love me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone...

When your education x-ray 
Can not see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing 
That I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone


Maybe I'm just blind...


Love me when I'm gone...

Love me when I'm gone
When I'm Gone
When I'm Gone
When I'm Gone

Dirty, making her mine 
I like it when I touch it, cuz she moan lil bit 
Jeans saggin', so I can see her thong lil bit 
I know she grown lil bit, 20 years old, you legal 
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal 
I swoop on her like an eagle, swoop down and rate 
I know your popular, but you gon be famous today 


She be shoppin at front nack, just look at her front back 
Man she's soo stacked, does she knows that I want that 
He make he's soo whack, girl can i taste your cat 
Gave her 300$ to spend, like buying a throw-back 
She stay in the club, like they be saying she got it 
In real life, girl remind me of pochantas 
She be at events, like the best when she past 
All the high rollin' cats, wana pay for that ssss 
Niggas half steppin', strapped with a nice weapon 
It's against the law for her to move them hips 
If you ever seen it dirty, your mouth gone drop 
World wide, fools volenteer tell you its off top 


Cuz I like it when she bring it back 
ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh do what you do 
Cuz I like it when she bring it back 
ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh do what you do 

Twerkin in a phatty girl halter top 
Can I touch you where it's sunny 
Or embarrass, and make you give us some money 
She should pose for sports illustriated 
It's like a picture perfect site 
when she passed all the other girls hated. 


I like that

2003,9,Picture,Kid Rock,Country,"
Livin' my life in a slow hell 
Different girl every night at the hotel 
I aint seen the sun shine in 3 damn days 
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whisky 
Wish I had a good girl to miss me 
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways 
I put your picture away 
Sat down and cried the day 
I can't look at you, I'm lyin' next to her 
I put your picture away, sat down and cried today 
I can't look at you I'm lyin' next to her 

I called you lastnight in the hotel 
Everyone knows but they wont tell 
But their half hearted smiles tell me 
Somethin' just ain't right 
I been waitin' on you for a long time 
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine 
I ain't heard from you in 3 damn nights 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him 
I saw ya yesterday with an old friend 

It was the same ole same ""how have you been"" 

Since you been gone my worlds been dark & grey 

You reminded me of brighter days 

I hoped you were comin' home to stay 
I was head of the church 

I was off to drink you away 

I thought about you for a long time 
Can't seem to get you off my mind 
I can't nderstand why we're living life this way 
I found your picture today 
I swear I'll change my ways 
I just called to say I want you to come back home 
I found your picture today 
I swear I'llc hange my ways 
I just called to say I want you to come back home 
I just called to say, I love you come back home
"
2003,10,Bring Me to Life,Evanescence,Nu metal,"How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb without a soul my spirit sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back home wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch without your love darling only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

2003,14,21 Questions,50 Cent,Hip hop,"
New York City!
You are now rapping...with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...

If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions
Are you my soulmate 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me Or up and leave me
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone
And always remember girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl...

Could you love me in a Bentley
Could you love me on a bus
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

It's such a shame, but I'm leavin'
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me

Uh, uh, uh

I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce

Well, I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son

And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right

All my pride is all I have
You'll be needin' me, but too bad
You had to your choice to run alone
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah

Promises you made about comin' through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

Uh, uh, uh
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settlin' down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here

Stop playin, you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone

People make mistakes to make up, to break
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothin' will ever be the same, so just be on your way
Go 'head and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me, you no
I know your game and I'm feelin' what you do

So I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah

2003,16,Beautiful,Christina Aguilera,Pop,"
Don't look at me


Every day is so wonderful

And suddenly, it's hard to breathe

Now and then, I get insecure

From all the fame, I'm so ashamed


I am beautiful no matter what they say

Words can't bring me down

I am beautiful in every single way

Yes, words can't bring me down

So don't you bring me down today


To all your friends, you're delirious

So consumed in all your doom

Trying hard to fill the emptiness

The piece is gone and the puzzle undone

That's the way it is


You are beautiful no matter what they say

Words won't bring you down

You are beautiful in every single way

Yes, words won't bring you down

Don't you bring me down today...


No matter what we do 


No matter what they say 


We're the song inside the tune

Full of beautiful mistakes


And everywhere we go 


The sun will always shine 


And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 

All the other times


We are beautiful no matter what they say

Yes, words won't bring us down

We are beautiful no matter what they say

Yes, words can't bring us down

Don't you bring me down today


Don't you bring me down today

Don't you bring me down today

Yeah
Shorty I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out either
I'ma give it all to you baby
It's on, bust it


I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road
I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma


Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older


Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

I thought that you'd be here by now 
There's nothing but the rain 
No footsteps on the ground 
I'm listening but there's no sound 

Isn't anyone tryin to find me 
Won't somebody come take me home 
It's a damn cold night 
Trying to figure out this life 
Wont you take me by the hand 
Take me somewhere new 
I don't know who you are 
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you

I'm looking for a place 
Searching for a face 
Is anybody here I know 
'Cause nothing's going right 
And everythigns a mess 
And no one likes to be alone 

Isn't anyone trying to find me 
Won't somebody come take me home 
It's a damn cold night 
Trying to figure out this life 
Wont you take me by the hand 
take me somewhere new

Oh why is everything so confusing 
Maybe I'm just out of my mind 
Yea yea yea

She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk 
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York? 
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head

2003,23,Into You,Fabolous,,"
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my babygirl in the interviews now
And I don’t bring the problems from the 90s and the 2 thou
Theres no reason to have a friend or two now
Cuz the kids ready to tell you how he feel and a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, imma do whatever just to keep a grin on u now
Where I roll, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn’t I wanna spend a few thou
On fifth ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I aint concerned with other men with you now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin to you now
And I aint jealous, it’s the principle now
I’m so into you

I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you
I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you

Come on ma
It’s more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in the quota we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure ever quarter be cashed in

I can’t really explain it
My friends be thinking I’m slipping 
These girls be thinking I’m tripping
What kinda weed u be smoking
What typa drinks u be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards are no limits 
So u don’t worry about maxing when u spends
But since u been asking about the friends
How’d u like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends

I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you
I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you

I don’t wanna trip, but the truth is
Girl the way you cook a stake
Remind me of the strips to Ruth chris 
U love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it aint because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dip the deuces
And you aint flattered by Canary’s and VS dip tay seuces 
All the ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don’t let them kinda #’s impress you
Even though I was so unsuccessful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter’s been wonderful, my summer’s been special
That’s why the same bar while the villa been painted
Just so we can really get acquainted 
The love is real, there’s no way you can feel like it’s tainted 
But I can’t really explain it, yeah

I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you
I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you
I really like what you’ve done to me
I can’t really explain it
I’m so into you

I can’t really explain it

Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
Shes my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup aint playin right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like im gassin ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonderin why he comin home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if ya'll bump heads it'll be a fight
But i said it'll be alright

And I know I live and grown
But i can't let ya go
And I know I live and grown
But I can't let ya go

You aint ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So i made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, i'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But i know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So i cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you aint too shy to do them freaky things
I aint gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin the whole world im your new allen springer
At first you were somethin i denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin in the ride
But shorty
Theres something that you provide
Cause the entre pain is good without somethin on the side


Uh oh, i might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if im a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely 
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R Kelly

You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings im'ma share wit you
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you

2003,25,Mesmerize,Ja Rule,,"
Haha, yeah
Whattup ma How you been
Yeah I know, I know, hehe


I, got a fetish for fuckin you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin so long I'm gettin anxious
but patiently waitin for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
flyin abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin, lovin the way you be moanin
Grippin the sheets, lookin at me lickin at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy


I wanna get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby


Shorty, are you really gettin bored with me, or him
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
You know you're right and I'm the type
to pull up to your bumper, get your number

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
But there's still nothin different boy, stick to the plan
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me


I love when you touch me baby
All over my body baby
I love when you kiss me baby
All over my body baby

"
2003,26,Where Is the Love?,Black Eyed Peas,Pop,"What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek

Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'

Where is the love
The love, the love

It just ain't the same, always unchanged
New days are strange, is the world insane
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin'
in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek

Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'

Where is the love
The love, the love

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' our wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
And would you turn the other cheek

Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'

So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love

This, whatever you make it to be
Sunshine set on this cold lonely sea
So please baby try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't sayin' goodbye that's knocking down the door of your candy store

It's all in this game of love
You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please hold me
You guide me
Divide me
Into what...

Make me feel good, yeah

So please tell me why don't you come around no more

Yeah, in the game of love

Roll me

"
2003,28,Lose Yourself,Eminem,Hip hop,"Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip 

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Is he No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da


No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another jam or not 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got


You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Your smile make my day it's simple, your dimple 
Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized 
Communication is deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk 
You make a nigga forget about a life full of DRAMA
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma 
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL 
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider 
I'm in heaven when I am inside her 
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck 
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct 
Have her drippin wet
She look in my eye and said she like but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nothing of it

2003,33,No Letting Go,Wayne Wonder,Reggae fusion,"
I remember when I had that little shorty uptown 
In the drop we would never stop runnin around 
She would lay up in the condo I was a clown 
You would cry up on the doorstep stomp and pound 
Throwin up hysterical you fell on the ground 
I chose lust over love, as foul as it sounds 

Takes good care of me, like it's her duty 

No letting go no holding back 

And we got a sea coast gettin live on the speed boat 
We made it now and I'm just glad to be able to let all the fables drown 
So you can have more than a piece of my love 


She caught me in the crib with her I was a fool 
That's a major violation baby that wasn't cool 
Beyond my manly pride deep down I knew 
Made a valent guard that I would treat you right 
I realize now it ain't all about ice 

When I'm with you it's all of that, all of that, yeah yeah yeah

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Well, I've been afraid of changing 'cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well...

Well, I've been afraid of changing 'cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Year and if you climb a mountain and ya turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well maybe
Well maybe
Well maybe the landslide will bring you down

2003,37,'03 Bonnie & Clyde,Jay-Z,Hip hop,"Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..

Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the westside - highway
Doing what we like to do - our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B


The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!


If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

How you check me, can you give me the oochie walla walla
Swallow a couple shots of Jag and make a dolla
Lil' mama in the crib with a poke to complete your scalla
Talk about an example of a shorty that might need to prowla
Got a chick in the bug, it come with a little shoppahora
Take you to the Caribbean down the Carolina
To the Mediterranean and enjoy the water
When the role is wacky, you keepin' me stocky
Takin' care of this super Mike
When you check on your Papi
When you're right baby, hug me with all your might
And put it on, cause you know it's on tonight
Break up or make up, you know we I'm gone
when you find an empty ride
we will be together and still be bright

Never ever wanna let you go
Tell me what you're feeling, cause I want to know
If you're around, you know I'm down
I'll be that girl that keeps you around
I'm only here, just because

You lovin', hate the type that love everyone to see
I got a playa right, cause this kid don't usually let them stay tonight
And when I know you wrong, I say it right
And when I wanna say no, I say I might
Cause it's real talk, you know it ain't another
And anytime I'm gone, you know I'm thinkin of you
And anytime you need, you know I got you covered
You know none of the others do what I does

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight
Hard to the core
Core to the right
Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton


Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her beign preganant by Michael Jackson

Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

you want love

Swimming a deep sea

and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
Cause you were born on the fourth of july, 
freedom ring now something on the surface it stings
that something on the surface it kind of makes me nervous 
who says that you deserve this
and what kind of god would serve this? 
We will cure this dirty old disease
if you've got the poison I've got the remedy

the remedy is the experience. 
It is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that its serious. 
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend 
the rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends 
because it all amounts to nothing in the end.

I won't worry my life away.
I won't worry my life away.

I heard two men talking on the radio 
in a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
they were counting down the days 
to stab the brother in the be right back after this
the unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath 
is sure to outlast his catastrophe
dance with me, 
because if you've got the poison, 
I've got the remedy 

the remedy is the experience. 
It is a dangerous liaison

There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun

because it all amounts to nothing in the end.

I won't worry my life away.
I won't worry my life away.
I won't and I won't and I won't etc.

2003,53,Why Don't You & I,Santana,,"Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Well, why don't you just be like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody's changed so gimme a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?

You gotta puff a J on this one {*inhales*}
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gocha 9-7
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh

You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Ex-cuse me; what's your name

Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second
Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be hangin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
Excuse me miss, what's your name
Can you come, hang with me
Possibly, can I take you out, to-night

You already know what it's hittin for
Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin on
50/50 venture with them S dots kickin off
Armadale poppin now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
to play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us
Only dudes movin units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
.. it's the Roc in here!
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at a airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

that should be rollin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
that should be rollin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""
But fukkit, let the +Fish-burne+
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!


Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
you can easily get past, but that chapter is done
... but I'm done readin for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes
Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name

2003,58,I Can,Nas,Conscious hip hop,"
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when 
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how


Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this


Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control 
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince thats when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

2003,59,Underneath It All,No Doubt,Reggae fusion,"There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're... 
You're something else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely 

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad 


So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better... better... 

You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps stalin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
That so many adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
You're good for me, baby
Oh that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be


You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lovely
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

I'm here without you baby

2003,67,Can't Hold Us Down,Christina Aguilera,R&b,"

So what am I not supposed to have an opinion

Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman

Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind

Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled


When a female fires back

Suddenly big talker don't know how to act

So he does what any little boy will do

Making up a few false rumors or two


That for sure is not a man to me

Slanderin' names for popularity

It's sad you only get your fame through controversy 

But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say


This is for my girls all around the world

Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

So what do we do girls

Shout out loud!

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

Lift your hands high and wave them proud

Take a deep breath and say it loud

Never can, never will, can't hold us down


Nobody can hold us down

Nobody can hold us down

Nobody can hold us down

Never can, never will


So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying

Are you offended by the message I'm bringing

Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing

Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing


If you look back in history

It's a common double standard of society

The guy gets all the glory the more he can score

While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore


I don't understand why it's okay

The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named

All my ladies come together and make a change

Start a new beginning for us everybody sing


This is for my girls all around the world

Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

What do we do girls

Shout out loud!

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud

Take a deep breath and say it loud

Never can, never will, can't hold us down



Check it - Here's something I just can't understand

If the guy have three girls then he's the man

He can either give us some head, sex her off

If the girl do the same, then she's a whore

But the table's about to turn

I'll bet my fame on it

Cats take my ideas and put their name on it

It's aiight though, you can't hold me down

I got to keep on movin'

To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack

Do it right back to him and let that be that

You need to let him know that his game is whack

And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back


But you're just a little boy

Think you're so cute, so coy

You must talk so big 

To make up for smaller things

So you're just a little boy

All you'll do is annoy

You must talk so big 

To make up for smaller things


This is for my girls...

This is for my girls all around the world

Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

So what do we do girls

Should out loud!

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud

Take a deep breath and say it loud

Never can, never will, can't hold us down


This is for my girls all around the world

Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud

Spread the word, can't hold us down
"
2003,69,Angel,Amanda Perez,,"It's been five months since you went away

Left without a word and nothing to say

When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul

But it wasn't good enough for you, no

So I asked God


God send me an angel

From the heavens above

Send me an angel to heal my broken heart

From being in love

'Cause all I do is cry

God send me an angel 

To wipe the tears from my eyes


And I know it might sound crazy

But after all that I still love you

You wanna come back in my life

But now there is something I have to do

I have to tell the one that I once adored

That they can't have my love no more

Cause my heart can't take no more lies

And my eyes are all out of cries


God send me an angel

From the heavens above

Send me an angel to heal my broken heart

From being in love

'Cause all I do is cry

God send me an angel 

To wipe the tears from my eyes


Now you had me on my knees 

Begging God please to send you back to me

I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep

You made me feel like I could not breathe

Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch

And give you all my love

But you took my love for granted

Want my lovin' now

But you can't have it

God


God send me an angel

From the heavens above

Send me an angel to heal my broken heart

From being in love

'Cause all I do is cry

God send me an angel 

To wipe the tears from my eyes




Send me an angel from the heavens above



Oh God, send me an angel


Ooohhhh..

2003,70,She Hates Me,Puddle of Mudd,,"Met a girl, thought she was grand
fell in love, found out first hand
went well for a week or two
then it all came unglued

in a trapp trip I can't grip
never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
then  I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
trust
she fucking hates me
la la la love
I tried too hard
and she tore my feelings like I had none
and ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
after that shit got sour
she took all I ever had
no sign of guilt
no feeling of bad, no

In a trapped trip I can't grip 
never thought i'd be the one who'd slip
then I started to realize
I was living one big lie


that's my story, as you see
learned my lesson and so did she
now it's over and i'm glad 
'cause i'm a fool for all i've said


la la la la la la la la la love
Trust
la la la la la la la la la love
Trust
and she tore my feelings like I had none
she fucking hates me

Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news 
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused 
Somebody blew up a building 
Somebody stole a car 
Somebody got away 
Somebody didn't get too far yeah 
They didn't get too far 

Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son 
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done 
Take all the rope in Texas 
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys 
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that 

Chorus: 

Justice is the one thing you should always find 
You got to saddle up your boys 
You got to draw a hard line 
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune 
We'll all meet back at the local saloon 
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces 
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses 

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds 
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets 
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground 
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down 
You can bet he'll set 'em down 'cause

Ma ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma I know you got that bomb bomb pussy

One thing leading to another let the party begin

One thing leading to another let the party begin

Just bring the liquor it's already eight shawties
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, get there I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' he glistening""
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit, aww shit


Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk and acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about it, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island


Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In


Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, Disturbing Tha Peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holidae In
Bring a gang of that Hen, some DSOP
Oh wee, and light that sticky icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Now what I'm talking bout
We gon' disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin
We chillin' and nuttin'

Thinking, that you were true

I guess I, I couldn't trust

'Cause your bluff time is up

'Cause I've had enough

You were, there by my side

Always, down for the ride

But your, joy ride just came down in flames

'Cause your greed sold me out of shame, mmhmm


After all of the stealing and cheating

You probably think that I hold resentment for you

But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do

I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through

So I wanna say thank you


'Cause it makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

It makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Makes me that much smarter

So thanks for making me a fighter


Oh, ohh


Never, saw it coming

All of, your backstabbing

Just so, you could cash in

On a good thing before I realized your game

I heard, you're going around

Playing, the victim now

But don't, even begin

Feeling I'm the one to blame

'Cause you dug your own grave, uh huh


After all of the fights and the lies

Yes you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore

Uh, no more, oh no, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture

I wouldn't know how to be this way now, and never back down

So I wanna say thank you


'Cause it makes me that much stronger

Makes me work a little bit harder

Makes me that much wiser

So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster

Made my skin a little bit thicker

2003,80,Thugz Mansion,2Pac,Acoustic hip hop,"
Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean  Where do niggaz go when we die
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy..
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy..

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful  I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
the deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion


Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

2003,86,Red Dirt Road,Brooks & Dunn,Country,"I was raised off of old Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down a red dirt road

I went out into the world, and I came back in
I lost Mary, oh I got her back again
And driving home tonight feels like I've found a long lost friend

Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was i thinkin'
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was i thinkin'
Oh, i knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...'cause i was 
Thinkin''bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin''bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where the night might lead
I know what i was feelin'
But what was i thinkin'...what was i thinkin'
By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was i thinkin'
Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was i thinkin' 
Oh, i knew there'd be hell to pay 
But that crossed my mind a little too late...'cause i was
When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo 
Tried to cut in i knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like bo duke
What was i thinkin'
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was i thinkin', oh what was i thinkin'

2003,88,Flying Without Wings,Ruben Studdard,Pop,"Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be
Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lovers eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find the cheer in every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it the works of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry
You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your lives
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to find for every dream
'Cuz who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunlight on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place
It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you smile
And it's the flying without wings
'Cuz you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings
You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings 
I'm flying without wings
"
2003,89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,Hip hop,"Verse #1 
These ideas are nightmares for white parents 
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings 
Like whatever they say has no bearing 
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing 
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring 
Alone in his own zone, and he dont care 
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out 
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin out 
Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out 
But if he ever saw him again, he'd prolly knock him out 
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back 
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap 
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap 
His step-father hit him so he socked him back 
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home 
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go 
Come on... 

Chorus: 
Sing with me now, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing with me now,just for today 
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away 

Verse #2 
Entertainment is danger, intertwine it with gansters 
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum 
Only you're unholy, only have one homey 
Only this gun, lonely, cuz don't anyone know me 
But everybody just feels like they can relate 
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great 
Or they can be great, or even worse, they can teach hate 
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make 
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum 
Now how the fuck did this metamorphasis happen? 
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' 
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass 
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you 
Fans turn on you, attorney's all gonna turn it to 
To get their hands on every dime you have 
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad 
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon 
You need to spew, dont hesitate to produce air-guns 
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me 
Swiftly just to get me offa these streets quickly 
But all their kids been listen'n to me religiously 
So i'm signing cds while police fingerprint me 
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me 
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesnt make sense, Pete 
It's all political, if my music is literal and i'm a criminal, 
How the fuck can i raise a little girl? 
I couldn't. i wouldn't be fit to 
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! 

Chorus 

Verse #3 
They say music can alter moods and talk to you 
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too? 
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude 
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and i'll get sued 
See what these kids do, is hear about us toting pistols 
And they want to get one, cos they think the shit's cool 
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves 
We're entertainers, of course this shit's affecting our sales 
You ignoramus. but music is reflection of self 
We just explain it, and then we get our cheques in the mail 
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin' 
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted 
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing 
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine 
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long 
Idolise their favourite rappers and know all they songs 
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives 
So they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die 
Till they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe 
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes 
That's why we sieze the moment, and try to freeze it and own it 
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cos we consider these minutes golden 
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone 
Just let our spirits live on, through out lyrics that you hear in our songs 
And we can

Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones

Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me

Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'

With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'

Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'

2003,96,Like a Stone,Audioslave,Alternative rock,"On a cobweb afternoon
In a room of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
Alone

On my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The win was bled
And there you led me on


And on I read
Until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wonder on

I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road along

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Never know what kind of car i'll be in,
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
You don't want that, 
Neither do I,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
Too much pride,
Between you and I,
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
How could it ever be just us two
Never loved you enough to trust you,
We just met and I just fucked you,
But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,

You're just plain ol' Marshall to me... 

Ooh yeah girl run that game... 

Haily Jade...I love that name,
Love that tattoo...what's that say
'rot in pieces' aww that's great... 

First off you don't know Marshall,
Add also, don't grow partial,
That's ammo for my arsenal,
I'll snap you off that bar stool,
There goes another lawsuit,
Leave handprints all accross you,
Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle,
You want what you can't have,
Ooh girl that's too damn bad,
Don't touch what you can't grab,
End up with two back hands,
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand,
Girl you just blew your chance,
Don't mean to ruin your plans,
But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...

Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wild
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can

Typ:  Songtext










Up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I 



I seen shorty she was checking up on me 

From the game she was spitting in my ear 





So I got up and followed her to the floor 

She said ""baby let's go"" 





Shorty got down on me, said come and get me 


I got so caught up, I forgot she told me 


Covering my girl, she be the best up on me 


Next thing I knew, she was all up one me screaming 







She's all up in my head now 

Got me thinking that it might 

Be a good idea to take her with me 


And I got to keep it real now 

Cause on a 1 to 10, she's a certified 20 


Cause I don't - know, if I take that chance 

She swears he's gonna leave 

But what I do - know, is the way she dance 

Make shorty alright with me 

The way's she's Getting Low!! 

I'm like yeah, just work that out for me 

She asks for one more dance, and I'm like yeah 


And I say. 







Yeah yeah - yeah! 



Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous 

In the club looking so conspicuous 

And RAWR!! These women all on the prowl 

If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow 

And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth! 

I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!! 

So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes 

Then ""bend over to the front! and touch your toes!!"" 

I - left the Jag I took the Rolls 


How ya like me now? 

When my pinky's baguette over three hundred thou-sand! 

Let's drink, you the one to please 

Ludacris fill cups like double D's 

Me and Ush' once more, and we leaves em dead 

We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say. 









Take that and rewind it back 


Take that, rewind it back 


Take that, rewind it back 


Take that, rewind it back

2004,3,If I Ain't Got You,Alicia Keys,R&b,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, Yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share 
With no one who truly cares for me 

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

2004,4,This Love,Maroon 5,Pop rock,"I was so high I did not recognize

The fire burning in her eyes

The chaos that controlled my mind

Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane

Never to return again

But always in my heart


This love has taken its toll on me

She said Goodbye too many times before

And her heart is breaking in front of me

I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore


I tried my best to feed her appetite

Keep her coming every night

So hard to keep her satisfied

Kept playing love like it was just a game

Pretending to feel the same

Then turn around and leave again


This love has taken its toll on me

She said Goodbye too many times before

And her heart is breaking in front of me

I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore


I'll fix these broken things

Repair your broken wings

And make sure everything's alright

My pressure on her hips

Sinking my fingertips

Into every inch of you

Cause I know that's what you want me to do

there's many things I wish I didn't do

but I continue learning

I never meant to do those things to you

and so I have to say before I go

that I just want you to know


I've found a reason for me

to change who I used to be

a reason to start over new

and the reason is you


I'm sorry that I hurt you

It's something I must live with everyday

and all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away

and be the one who catches all your tears

thats why i need you to hear

2004,9,Goodies,Ciara,Hip hop,"My Goodies, My Goodies, My Goodies
Not my goodies!

I got a sick reputation for handlin broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more.
And it's a wrap
Tell lady to bring my lap
And I ain't comin back
So you can put a car right there.
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove.
An you can ask anybody
Cuz they seen me do it.
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em.
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use.
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit.
Yeah freaky petey love you too.
Ha Ha
You know how I do..

You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl.
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for:
Sexy, independent, gotta spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it.

I bet you want the goodies.
Bet you thought about it.
Got you all hot and bothered.
Mad cause I talk around it.
Lookin for the goodies
Keep on lookin' cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh

Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin home with you.
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie.
If you ain't
Sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it so you already know.
I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Tryna hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it


So damn hot but so young.
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shawty
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is.
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the baddest.
I been workin' at it ever since i came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet but I'm gettin' better at it.
Matter of fact,
Lemme tell it to you one mo' again
Ain't naa chick in here dat I can't have
Bada boom bada bam ba bam!

You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top.
No you can't call me later
And I don't want your number.

Just respect the play I'm callin'.

Yeah... My niggas...
Throw ya hands in the air right now man...
Feel this shit right here... 

I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's,
Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called armed robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit.
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.

Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
See we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

R to the E'zzy',
My arms stay breezy, 
The Don's stay fizz-i,
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 740'fizz-i
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,
With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless, check it, said it?!
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed 
now we 'bout to change the game nigga.

Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

Now we livin' better now, 
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.
'Cause half these rappers get ""Blow"" like Dereck Foreal.
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.

my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up our pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right 

I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring da cool whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on

Man I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

I'm a play this Vandross 
You gon' take your pants off
Imma play this Gladys Knight

From the Chi and I be
Sippin Hennessy
Play some R&B
Tryina smoke a B
Lookin properly
Feelin on a G?
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm
Smokin on a B
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B
And I got to leave
something to the 23's?
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl 
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me


Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin' 
Tryina make you moan

2004,17,Someday,Nickelback,Post-grunge,"How the hell did we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed
And try turn the tables

I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong, just as long as
You know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now
I know you're wondering when
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

2004,19,My Immortal,Evanescence,Gothic pop,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all of my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Because your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
But now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
And though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

2004,21,Dirt Off Your Shoulder,Jay-Z,East coast hip hop,"I ordered a frappuccino
Where's my fuckin frappuccino
Alright, let's do this

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay I'm just
Trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be, so I'm
Lying my way from 

If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder


Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover
Tryin to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill

Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in
And now you think this person really is me and I'm
Trying to bend the truth
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 'cuz I'm

Lying my way from you
No no turning back now
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go
No no turning back now
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is ME

This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me

I'm only one call away
Gimme a call if you wanna come roll with me

It was weird how we met, huh
She was wit her mom in Bank America
I'm wit my son cashin the check
Would she like to explore the world up high
We can fly in my jet
Her reply was ""Yes, can I ask you somethin'?""
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin like all I wanted was sex
about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual; walks through the park
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush
To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk
Conversate about political subjects whatever's sparks
So I zoomed off, lookin by and my phone rang
Then I said. . .

Gimme a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away

The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball
Here she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showing out, trynta dunk trynta dribble break fast
Through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys lookin at me sayin ""Lil Howard you weak""
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, please don't
Told her ""I'm going home"" she asked can she go too
I'm like ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got thurr, I took a shower jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong said I looked at her and said. . .

Gimme a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Gimme a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away

Girl recognize game, before game recognize you
You're dealin wit a player, true
Now whatchu wanna do?
We can kick it and go puff on a bluuunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Hen' then we can get druuunk
It's up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cuz if you got an attitude I could treat you just like a hoe
Get to rollin wit me baby, hop in there's enough room
We can gaze at the stars that shine like the moon
Gimme a chance to show ya, and a chance to know ya
Just be true, and there's nothing I won't do, for ya
Don't worry be happy and smile and. . .

Gimme a call if you wanna come roll with me

No puedo creer que creyera 

Todo lo que tuvimos durase

Tan joven e ingenuo para mi de creer

Que ella era de tu pasado

Tonta de mi de soñar que algun dia tendria tus hijos

El amor es tan ciego

Se siente bien cuando esta mal


No puedo creer que cayera en tus esquemas

Soy mas elegante que eso

Tan tonto e ingenuo de creer que tu conmigo eres un hombre cambiado

Tonta de mi el competir

Cuando me engañas con una mujer fácil

Me cogió alguna vez pero ahora seguire adelante


Porque lo realice lo consegui

A mi misma

Eso es todo lo que tengo al final

Eso es todo lo que encontre fuera

Y no es necesario llorar

Cogi un voto pero ahora

Voy a ser mi propia mejor amiga


A mi misma

Eso es todo lo que tengo al final

Eso es todo lo que encontre fuera

Y no es necesario llorar

Cogi un voto pero ahora

Voy a ser mi propia mejor amiga


Controlando tanto, decias que me querias

Pero no me querias

Tu familia me contó un dia

Que lo veria en mi propio

La siguiente cosa que se es que me estoy relaccionando

Con tus tres hijos en mi casa

El amor es tan ciego

Se ve bien cuando esta mal


Ahora esta por encima

Paras de llamare

Vamos coge tu ropa

No es necesario afrontar como todavia estas conmigo

Todos tus familiares lo saben

Incluso tu mejor amigo

Intentó advertirme en lo bajo

Me cogió alguna vez

Pero ahora soy fuerte


Porque lo realice lo consegui

A mi misma

Eso es todo lo que tengo al final

Eso es todo lo que encontre fuera

Y no es necesario llorar

Cogi un voto pero ahora

Voy a ser mi propia mejor amiga


A mi misma

Eso es todo lo que tengo al final

Eso es todo lo que encontre fuera

Y no es necesario llorar

Cogi un voto pero ahora

Voy a ser mi propia mejor amiga


Me conseguí a mi misma

Se que nunca dispondré de mi misma

Todas las chicas, si os sentis como yo

Ayudarme a cantarlo

Ya, me hiciste daño

Pero aprendí un montón por el camino

Después de toda la lluvia

Verás el sol salir otra vez


Me conseguí a mi misma

Se que nunca dispondré de mi misma

Todas las chicas, si os sentis como yo

Ayudarme a cantarlo

Ya, me hiciste daño

Pero aprendí un montón por el camino

Después de toda la lluvia

Verás el sol salir otra vez

2004,33,Numb,Linkin Park,Nu metal,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Get em Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for

Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feelin'
No one but me and you


I wont tell, your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary


I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Oooh baby if there is anything that you fear 
Call 489 4608 and I'll be here


I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary


Only we know what is talked about, Baby boy
I don't know how you could be driving me so crazy
Baby when you're in town
Why don't you come around 
I'll be the loyalty you need
You can trust me

2004,35,She Will Be Loved,Maroon 5,Pop rock,"Beauty queen of only eighteen

She had some trouble with herself

He was always there to help her

She always belonged to someone else


I drove for miles and miles

And wound up at your door

I've had you so many times but somehow

I want more


I don't mind spending everyday

Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

She will be loved


Tap on my window knock on my door

I want to make you feel beautiful

I know I tend to get insecure

It doesn't matter anymore


It's not always rainbows and butterflies

It's compromise that moves us along

My heart is full and my door's always open

You can come anytime you want


I don't mind spending everyday

Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

She will be loved


I know where you hide

Alone in your car

Know all of the things that make you who you are

I know that goodbye means nothing at all

Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

2004,36,White Flag,Dido,Pop,"I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

How far is heaven, Lord can you tell me

Cause I've been locked up way too long
In this crazy world, how far is heaven

Just keep on livin', how far is heaven

And just keep on giving, how far is heaven

In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose
One half won't do

I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

Oh, I'd tell myself
What good do you do
Convince myself

Oh, It's my life
Don't you forget
Oh, It's my life

How much do you

And by Wednesday, I can't sleep

Then the phone rings, I hear you

And the darkness is a clear view

Cuz you've come to rescue me


Fall... With you, I fall so fast

I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts



Ohhhhh

It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real

I like the way that feels

Ohhhhh

It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself

I love how you can tell

All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me


I am moody, messy

I get restless, and it's senseless

How you never seem to care


When I'm angry, you listen

Make me happy is your mission

And you won't stop til I'm there


Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast

Well, I hit that bottom

Crash, you're all I have



Ohhhhh

It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real

I like the way that feels

How do you know everything I'm about to say?

Am I that obvious?

And if it's written on my face...

I hope it never goes away... yeah


On a Monday, I am waiting

And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...

So I can breathe

So won't ya come and sit and talk to me?
And tell me how we're gonna be together always.
Hope you know when it's late at night.
I Hold on to my pillow tight.
And think of how you promised me forever.
Could make me feel this way
Is just a chance to say

It's the end of you and me
all the lies
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste

Tell why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know that truth
How could you ever be so cold
To go behind my back and call my friend 
Boy you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
Well it didn't work out that way

It's the end of you and me
all the lies
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste

I wanted you right here with me but I have no choice you've
gotta leave
Because my heart is breakin'
With every word I'm sayin'
I gave up everything I had 
On something that just wouldn't last 
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these
Eyeee-eeee-eeees

Get out

all the lies
You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste

You know what the mid-west is? 

Young and Restless 





I walk throught the valley where the shadow of death is. 

Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless 

Try to catch it ... it's kind of hard 

Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method. 

They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us 

Saying We eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast 

Huh? Yall eat pieces of sh*t what's the basis? 

We ain't going no where but got suits and cases. 

A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis. 

My momma used to say only Jesus can save us. 

Well momma I know I act a fool 

But I'll be gone til November. I got packs to move I hope. 




God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 


The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now. 


And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong 


I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long 



To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers... 


To the victims of welfare feel we living in hell here, hell yea... 


Now hear ye hear ye wanna see thee more clearly 

I know He hear me when my feet get weary 

Cause we're the almost nearly extinct 

We rappers is role models we rap we don't think 

I ain't here to argue about his facial features 

Or here to convert atheist into believers 

I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers 

The way Kathy Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus 

So here go my single dawg radio needs this 

They said you can rap anything except for Jesus 

That means guns, sex, lies, videotape 

But if I talk bout God my record won't get played 

Huh? 

Well if this take away from my spins 

Which will probably take away from my ends 

Then I hope it take away from my sins 

And bring the day that I'm dreamin 'bout 

Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out...

Knocked me on d block when I was burning the hemph,
Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent,
Locked up and they wont let me out,

I'm steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do.

My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops partolin, and now they done stop me,
And I get locked up,

They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Headin up town to re up,
Back with a couple peeps,
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as feens,
Makin so much money,
Products movin' fast,
Put away the stash,
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
Ima ride or die and stay d blocked up
Two tooth brushes up,

Cuz I'm locked up they cant get me out,
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out,
Go and hit the bar when the reds be out,
Cant wait for the day when they let me out,

Cuz visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me,

Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life,
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right

Oh when it all...


It All Falls Down


Im Tellin You Alll 


It All Falls Down ..


Oh when it all...

It All Falls Down


Im Telling You All

It All Falls Down

Oh when it all...



Man I promise she so self consciouss

She has no idea what she doing in college

That major that she majored in don't make no money

But she won't drop out her parent's look at her funny

Now tell me that an't insecurr

The concept of school seems so securr

Sophmore three yurr an't picked a carurr

She's like Fuck I'll just stay down here and do hair

Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs

Cause her baby daddy don't really care

She so precious with the peer pressure

Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis 

She had hair so long that it looked like weave

Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve

And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

Single black female addicted to retail



Oh when it all...

It All Falls Down


Im Tellin You All...

It All Falls Down




Man I promise I'm so self conscious

Thats why you always see me with a least one of my watches

Rollies and pasha's done drove me crazy

I can't even pronounce nothing, yo pass the versace

Then I spent $400 bucks on this

Just be like N**** you an't up on this

And I can't even go to the grocery store

With out some ones that are clean and a shirt with a team

It seems we living the American Dream

But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem

The prettiest people do the ugliest things

For the road to the riches and the diamond rings

We shine because they hate us floss because they degrade us

We trying to buy back our 40 acres

And for that paper look how we'll stoop

Even if your in a benz you still a n**** in a coup





I say F*** the police thats how I treat them

We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom

We buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need them

Things we buy to cover up whats inside

Cuz they made us hate ourselfs and love they wealth

Thats why shorty's holla where the ballas at?

Drug dealer's buy jordans crackhead buy crack

And the white man get paid off of all of that

But i an't even gonna act holier than thou

Cause f*** it I went to Jacob with 25 thou

Before i had a house and i'll do it again

Cause i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz

I wanna act balerific like its all terrific

I got a couple of past few bills won't get specific

I got a problem with spending money before I get it

We all self conscious, I'm just the first to admit it



Oh when it all...

It All Falls Down


Im Tellin You All .. 

It All Falls Down



Oh .... Yah ... Watcha Gunna Do When It All Falls Down?

2004,48,Toxic,Britney Spears,Dance-pop,"Baby, can't you see 
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it

Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

-Chorus-
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late 
To give you up
I took a sip 
From my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high 
Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

-Chorus-
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

-Chorus- x2

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
That hoe fine but this hoe killer
She leakin, she's soakin' wet
She leakin, soakin' wet

Pussy poppin, till you percolate
First booty on duty no time to wait
Make it work, with your wet t-shirt
Bitch you gotta shake it till ya calf muscles hurt
Say the heals on your feet or the strap around your ankle
Call that bitch bojangles
Juicy like fruit or dosh like coup Deville
Used to get loose on the goose for real

Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got ten then bring a friend
Hoe shake your ass to the song then
If you ain't with it then well gone then
We ain't no boys we grown men
If you ain't gone dance then don't then
Why you wanna waste a niggaz song
then see your ass down doin nothin


Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up and down make a nigga want it
Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up and down make a nigga want it
Roll that ass round and round like a motherfuckin' wheel
Shake that shit this ain't no motherfuckin' drill
Roll that ass round and round like a motherfuckin' wheel
Shake that shit this ain't no motherfuckin' drill
Get crunk with it, get loose with it
Like short said let bruce bruce hit it
Get crunk with it, get loose with it
Like short said let bruce bruce hit it


Shake it like a dollar five or ten
But what would you do for 2a twenty twen
Get on the stage shake that ass then
Get on the pole do a back bend
I like that do it again
Here's another ten bitch do it again
Work like a game that you playin' to win
Make that pussy fart for the Ying Yang Twins
Sixteen bitches in thongs in one club
The home of the fifth red bones and big butts
has been bitches splittin' all over the floor
Hornafy cant deny certified pro
Sixty-nine plenty time will pay a bill

2004,51,Meant to Live,Switchfoot,Alternative rock,"Fumbling his confidence 
And wondering why the world has passed him by 
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments 
And failed attempts to fly, fly 

We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
Somewhere we live inside 
Somewhere we live inside 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
Somewhere we live inside 

Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries 
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open 
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken 


We want more than this world's got to offer 
We want more than this world's got to offer 
We want more than the wars of our fathers 
And everything inside screams for second life, yeah

We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves? 
We were meant to live

2004,53,Sorry 2004,Ruben Studdard,R&b,"
It's like I missed a shot,
It's like I dropped the ball. 
It's like I'm on stage, 
and I forgot the words. 
It's like building a new house, 
with no roof and no doors.
It's like trying to propose, 
and I ain't got the ring. 

But girl I've apologized 
a million times before.
So here it comes again 
for all the wrong I've done. 
Here's One million one. 

Girl this is my sorry for, 2004.
And I aint gonna mess up no more, this year.
I'm 'a take this one chance,
and make it real clear.
I'm sorry for May 
in case I dont tell you. 
August, September, October, November 'till your December. 
I'm Sorry. 

Its like stayin' out at night, 
had way too much to drink.
It's like you change your hair,
and I dont say a thing.
It's like we're fallin' fast asleep, 
with no kiss, and before we hit. 
And It's like I forgot your gift,
on 02 14 03. 

But girl I've apologized 
a million times before.

I'm sorry for the way that I did you
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart for how I hurt you girl
I'm sorry on the weekends, sorry on the weekdays
sorry for the things I did, Sorry for the things i said
sorry for the lies
sorry for the time
That I didn't get you what you want, 
That I didn't get you what you like.
What can I do to tell you that I'm sorry babe.

Wooooooooh!
All them strip clubs,

2004,54,My Happy Ending,Avril Lavigne,Grunge,"So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something You said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high 
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be


It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done


Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
So much for my happy ending

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Light the roof on fire 

Nigga what you say 

We get loose in this motherfucker

Light the roof on fire fire fire 


Now I ain't putting nothing out

I smoke when I wanna 

26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer 

This heat 'gon last for the whole summer 

Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner 

Rocks on my wrist rolls gold under 

Glocks on my hip those throw thunder 

I'm buying diamond by the pier 

But when you stop the only thing still spinning is your ear 

Yeah I'm riding with that all black snub 

Raiders cap back all black gloves 

I'm 80s man but the boy smack thugs 


Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs 

His impacts about as raw as crack was 

Now all these new artists getting raw deals 

I'm only 21 sitting on mills 


We on fire 

Up in here it's burning hot

Shell take it off if it get to hot up in this spot

We get loose in this motherfucker

Light the roof on fire fire fire 


If you know anything about me then you know I'm a baller 

If I ain't hit the first night I ain't gon' call her 

I'm trying to play you trying to have my daughter 

But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her 

And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her 


I got a diamond about as clear as water 

And I got bread but I ain't spend quarters 

So cut the games ma let's go in the back 

Matter fact turn your ass round back a nigga down 

And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town 

Like 'em small like em tall like 'em black like 'em brown 

She gotta be able to cum when I need her 

Tight ass pants little wife beater 

Regular chick or R&B diva 

Bitch say something I ain't a mind reader 


We on fire 

Up in here it's burning hot 

We on fire 

Shell take it off if it get to hot

2004,57,Walked Outta Heaven,Jagged Edge,R&b,"I'm rolling down a lonely highway asking god to please forgive me for messing up tha blessing he gave to me, i see,
Everything clearer now the nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, imma lose it, i pray that he would just shed his grace on me, i need just to be back with my baby

Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, gotta get right wit you
Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, feel like i just walk right out of heaven

See my mamma told me thats if its meant to be she'll come back and she'll forgive me and the best thing i can do it to just
Let her, let her go i know, i don't wanna do it
But if i continue to push she'll just pull away and i know that in my heart its a reality i didn't treat her like she wanted
To be treated, and i hope that shes not gone for good no no


Hey girl waiting for you all the time, suppose to move on with my life, and girl i tried and i tried
I feel like i can't walk, i feel like i can't talk girl i dont know what to do get back right with you i feel like i just
Walked outta heaven

If u ever loved somebody, and if you ever had somebody, but you know that you hurt that somebody, let me here you say yea

Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath

OOOh
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you

OOOh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me,
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me


OOOh
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction

OOOh
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get to steppin'


If you can't make me say OOO
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want none
If you can't make me say OOO
Like the beat of this groove

You don't have no business in this here's your papers
Baby you are dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed

2004,59,My Band,D12,Comedy hip hop,"I don't know dude...
I think everyone's all jealous and shit cuz I'm like the lead singer of a band dude...
And I think everyone's got a fuckin problem with me dude...
And they need to take it up with me after the show...
Because...

These chicks don't even know the name of my band...
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands...
Cuz once I blow they know that i'll be the man...
All because I'm the lead singer of my band...

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my god it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' god it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin god dude you fuckin rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band...
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands...
Cuz once I blow they know that i'll be the man...
All because I'm the lead singer of my band...
Roxanne

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
Cuz my shit is lookin smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band...
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands...
Cuz once I blow they know that i'll be the man...
All because I'm the lead singer of my band...

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
and it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name...
Cuz once I blow I know that i'll be the man...
All because I'm the lead singer of my band...

The hottest boy band in the world...
D12!
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa...
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

Can they, huh?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all away
Right down through the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the....
Chi-Town what's going on man

I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry y'll Mr. H 2 the Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs
No use me tryin' to be lyin'
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make the band
I swear this right here is history in the making man


I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe; safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
All they heard was that I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire


Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

2004,62,Why?,Jadakiss,Political hip hop,"Aha
It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that

Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least


Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why

I stepped in a club in your hood

You and your friends talking

Girl I'm off in your head 
So let's get in bed
And do what your mind said, whoooo

So baby take a ride with me 
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body that's my goal
So baby just come down here
And let the gravity whoooo, whoooo

I can read your mind babe
I know what your thinking
And it's alright with me 
It's alright, yes

I can read your mind babe
I know what you're thinking
Girl I'm off in your head
So let's get in bed
And do what your mind said

I know you wanna rub me 
Know you wanna touch me 
Know you wanna feel me
Baby keep it real
Know you wanna see
Know you wanna be
In my B.E.D. we'll be getting freaky

2004,66,One Thing,Finger Eleven,,"Restless tonight
Cause I wasted the light
Between both these times
I drew a really thin line
It’s nothing I planned
And not that I can
But you should be mine
Across that line

If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldn’t that be something

I promise I might
Not walk on by
Maybe next time
But not this time

Even though I know
I don’t want to know
Yeah I guess I know
I just hate how it sounds


Even though I know
I don’t want to know

2004,74,Breakaway,Kelly Clarkson,Folk pop,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
I'll make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
And breakaway


Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway

2004,77,100 Years,Five for Fighting,Soft rock,"I'm 15 for a moment
Caught in between 10 and 20
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are
I'm 22 for a moment
She feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars

Time to buy and time to lose
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live
I'm 33 for a moment
Still the man, but you see I'm a they
A kid on the way
A family on my mind
I'm 45 for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy, Time to lose yourself
Within a morning star
15 I'm all right with you
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live
Half time goes by
Suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye
67 is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on...
I'm 99 for a moment
Dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are
15 there's still time for you
22 I feel her too
33 you're on your way
Every day's a new day...
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose

2004,79,Breaking the Habit,Linkin Park,Alternative rock,"Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than any time before
I had no options left again

I dont want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit... tonight

Come through in something new, wit the invisible roof
Oh the settings on my necklace them invisible too...

Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi

2004,81,Live Like You Were Dying,Tim McGraw,Country,"He said I was in my early 40's,
With a lot of life before me, 
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime.
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays,
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time.
Asked him when it sank in, that this might really be the real end.
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news.
Man what ya do.
And he says,


I went sky divin', 
I went rocky mountain climbin', 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fumanchu.
And I loved deeper, 
And I spoke sweeter, 
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying, 
And he said someday I hope you get the chance,
To live like you were dyin'.

He said I was finally the husband, 
That most the time I wasn't.
And I became a friend a friend would like to have.
And all the sudden goin' fishing, 
Wasn't such an imposition.
And I went three times that year I lost my dad.
Well I finally read the good book,
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again.
And then.


Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it,
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it.

Sky divin', 
I went rocky mountain climbin', 
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fumanchu.
And I loved deeper, 
And I spoke sweeter, 
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'.
And he said someday I hope you get the chance,
To live like you were dyin'.

To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'.
To live like you were dyin'.

2004,82,Remember When,Alan Jackson,Country,"Remember when I was young and so were you
and time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are,
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

2004,83,Everytime,Britney Spears,Pop,"Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song is my sorry

Ohhhh

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, get there I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' he glistening""
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit, aww shit


Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk and acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about it, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island


Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo

I'll bear that cross with an honor,
'Cause freedom don't come free.

I'd rather drink beer all night 

In a tavern or in a honky tonk

Or on a four-wheel drive tailgate 

I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

Some people look down on me

But I don't give a rip 

I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip 


'Cause I'm a redneck woman 

I ain't no high class broad 

I'm just a product of my raising 

I say, 'hey ya'll' and 'yee-haw' 

And I keep my Christmas lights on 

On my front porch all year long 

And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song 

So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country 

Let me get a big 'hell yeah' 

From the redneck girls like me, hell yeah 

Victoria's Secret well their stuff's real nice 

But I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price 

And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV 

I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me

Well, you might think I'm trashy a little too hardcore

But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door


I'm a redneck woman 

I ain't no high class broad 

I'm just a product of my raising 

I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw' 

And I keep my Christmas lights on 

On my front porch all year long 

And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song

So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country

Let me get a big 'hell yeah'

From the redneck girls like me, hell yeah 


I'm a redneck woman

I'm just a product of my raising

And I know all the words to every ol' Bocephus song 

So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country 

Let me get a big 'hell yeah' 

From the redneck girls like me hell yeah 

Hell yeah, hell yeah

2004,98,Just Lose It,Eminem,Comedy hip hop,"Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
Ok..
Guess who's back?
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright Stop!.....Pajama time

Come here little kiddies, On my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Just lose it
Go crazy
Oh baby
Oh baby, baby

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna ""touch my body""

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
Beer Goggles! Blind!
I'm just tryna unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Just lose it
Go crazy
Oh baby
Oh baby, baby

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy we gotcha you on tape
yellin' at an old lady 'Touch my body!'""

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin' it's the season
It's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world

2004,100,I Go Back,Kenny Chesney,Country,"""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song...

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin my first love out to the levvy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song....

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back, I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir
Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, 

I go back....
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back....
To watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall...
I go back....
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him...
I go back... I go back... I go back

2005,1,We Belong Together,Mariah Carey,R&b,"I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't
Hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause baby

When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'
Wait a minute
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life baby


When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together

You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame 
Don't even know what you're worth 
Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
Cause you're bad and it shows 
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know

2005,7,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,Green Day,Alternative rock,"I walk a lonely road 
The only one that I have ever known 
Don't know where it goes 
But it's home to me and I walk alone 

I walk this empty street 
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams 
Where the city sleeps 
and I'm the only one and I walk alone 

I walk alone 
I walk alone 

I walk alone 
I walk a... 

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone 

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah, 
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah 

I'm walking down the line 
That divides me somewhere in my mind 
On the border line 
Of the edge and where I walk alone 

Read between the lines 
What's fucked up and everything's alright 
Check my vital signs 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone 

I walk alone 
I walk alone 

I walk alone 
I walk a... 

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone

I'll let you lick the lollypop 
Go 'head girl, don't you stop 
I'll take you to the candy shop 
Boy one taste of what I got 
I'll have you spending all you got 

You can have it your way, how do you want it 
You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it 
Temperature rising, okay lets go to the next level 
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a teakettle 
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple 
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho 
In the hotel or in the back of the rental 
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into 
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor 
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha 
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem 
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider 
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit 
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can 



Give it to me baby, nice and slow 
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo 
You ain't never heard a sound like this before 
Cause I ain't never put it down like this 
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper 
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker 
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs 
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone 
I touch the right spot at the right time 
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind 
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind 
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin 
Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping 
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on 
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone 

I take you to the candy shop 
I'll let you lick the lollypop 
Go 'head girl, don't you stop 
I'll take you to the candy shop 
Boy one taste of what I got 
I'll have you spending all you got

2005,10,Behind These Hazel Eyes,Kelly Clarkson,Pop rock,"Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

2005,15,Shake It Off,Mariah Carey,R&b,"I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
shake it off

I gotta shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciated all the love I give

And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his—chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, let me go

And I just can't look its killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr Brightside

I'm coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine

Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and -- a lil bit

Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's

She musta heard about the dough
Now captain come on and save a hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart, all the time mayn
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, thats without a doubt
And shorty shake that thang like a pro mayn
She back it up on me I'm like oh mayn
I get close enough to her so I know she can hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit

Now its hard for me with my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony

Make me say anything; just to get you back again
Why can we just try

So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you, what if you were good to me
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door

2005,24,Hate It or Love It,The Game,Hip hop,"
Ya, let's take em back

Uh huh


Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl

Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world

Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies

My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody

I wanna live good so should I sell dope for a fo-finger ring

Money and them gold ropes

Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat

If I can move a few packs and get the hat now that'd be dope

Tossed and turned in my sleep at night

Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike

Different day same shit ain't nothing good in the hood

I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could



Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop


Go head' envy me

I'm raps MVP

And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me


Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop


Go head' envy me

I'm raps MVP

And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me



On the grill of my lowrider

Guns on both sides right above the gold wires

I'll fo-five em

Kill a nigga on my song but really do it

Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~

10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces

Believe you me homie I know all bout losses

I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious

One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy

I stay strapped like car seats

Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's

That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s

Told Banks when I met him imma ride

And if I gotta die rather homicide

I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died

Now I'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on

See how time fly?




From the beginnin to the end

Losers lose, winners win

This is real we ain't got to pretend

The cold world that we in

Is full of pressure and pain

Enough of me nigga now listen to Game



Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench

Now I'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~

My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent

And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz

Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range

Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes

When there's kids starvin

Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage

I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin

No school books they use that wood to build coffins

Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted

I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion

I love ya Ma'

Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
St. Tropez to la Defense
A perfume latin lovers' scent
A pleasure sweet my body heat
My army of lovers
My gentlemen polite and proud
From london Town I wave goodbye
The scorpio is rising high
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Pour l'univers on quitte la terre
Hereux joyeux
L'amour de Dieux n'a pas de frontiþres
Pour l'armþe qui voyage sous la lumiþre
In crystal snow my palace guard
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
Come shoot me with your laserbeam
My army of lovers
Taj Mahal I've come to rest
A royal bed a lovers' nest
Classic art we here explore
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Around the world my army of lovers

The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league

Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier go to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in harlem
Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute

2005,27,Breakaway,Kelly Clarkson,Folk pop,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
I'll make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
And breakaway


Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway

Hear that, how the veteran glide the record 
But don't download, go out and buy the record 
Hey, something sexy bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her 
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing 
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something 
I'm just a sucker for a hot track 
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that' 
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round 
Now bring it on back, break it down 
Now switch


Uh uh uh 
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody 
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party 
Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting 
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written 
First one in, last one out the club 
Bursting in, passing out in the club 
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm 
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm 
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm 
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on 
Switch


Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared

It ain't really that hard to do and 
I aint trying to be in love with you and 
All I wanted was a moment or two to 
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and 
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and 
The thick body and the rear one too and

See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me

Now I done been with different kind of girls
And I done seen the best of the best
If you know how I feel when I chill
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
Cause when we first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin or actin shady cause baby you kno

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me

Your love is a-mazing to me
The one you can hang with

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me

It ain't nothin it's you the one I care for
And affection cause i'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but i'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you kno
And you be trippin cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I hollared to right after my shows
And I was trippin in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you what imma do without you
I gotta get it together say whateva
But since I met you my life seems so betta

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me

In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top

Y ya es de madrugada
No mas pensando en como voy hacer te mi mujer
Tu beso me enlócese
Y no entiendo como crece
Este amor profundamente no lo puedo sostener
Son las cinco de la mañana
Y no puedo dormir
No mas pensando en como estar junto a ti
Me siento inútil sin ti
No se que voy hacer si no estas aquí
Amor, no es amor
Amor, no es amor
Se que no me perteneces
Se que tienes alguien mas
Pero se que no lo quieres por tu forma de hablar
Y se que si me dejaras
Continuar con mis llamadas
Quizás yo cambiaria tu manera de pensar
Y no me importa si andas con el
Solo quiero serte entender
Que yo si puedo darte mas, mas, mas que el
Son las cinco de la mañana
Y no puedo dormir
No mas pensando en como estar junto a ti
Me siento inútil sin ti
No se que voy hacer si no estas aquí

Me gusta como me haces sentir

Me gusta como me haces sentir

2005,35,Listen to Your Heart,DHT,Alternative rock,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile.
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.
You've built a love but that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. 

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye. 

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
the feeling of belonging to your dreams. 

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye. 

And there are voices
that want to be heard.
So much to mention
but you can't find the words.
The scent of magic,
the beauty that's been
when love was wilder than the wind.

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye. 

Listen to your heart, mm-mmmmmm

and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye.

2005,36,Scars,Papa Roach,Alternative rock,"I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand


I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life

You wont get out the county, 'cos you're damn ass free

A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I dont get sleep, no..

Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down

Lining them up-a like ass cracks,
Ladies, homies, at the track

Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
watch me as I gravitate
hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
this motown,
with yo sound
you're in the place
you gonna bite the dust
Cant fight with us
With yo sound
you kill the INC.

Yo, watch the way I navigate

And the cat's caught in the dryer 
Philosophy's a liar when 
Your home is your headstone 
""Icon"" is the last chance for hope 
When there's no such thing as heroes 
Your faith lies in the ditch that 
You dug yourself in 

Last chance to piss it all away 
Nothing but hell to pay 
When the lights are going down 

Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
On a noose over your home 

Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
But at least you're not alone 
Christmas lights in the middle of August 
Grudges come back to haunt us 
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies 
Grounded in a duplex to find that 
You're living on a landmine 
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive 

Last chance to piss it all away 
Nothing but hell to pay 
When the lights are going down 

Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
On a noose over your home 

Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray 
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high 
But at least you're not alone

Want to do is...not to....give up......

2005,43,Photograph,Nickelback,Post-grunge,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if It's too late
Should i go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it

So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
Everytime I do it makes me

cuz ever since my girl left me, my whole life came crashin



Cant believe I hadda girl like you and I just let you walk right outta my life,

Cuz aint nowhere in the globe id rather be,

A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide

Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide

You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide

The innocent can never last
Wake me up when september ends

Like my fathers come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when september ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when september ends

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when september ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends

Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when september ends

But don't turn around 
Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me 
Slow down never seen anything so lovely 
Now turn around 
And bless me with your beauty, cutie 

A butterfly tattoo 
Right above your navel 
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl 
Come take a walk with me 
You'll be impressed by 
The game that I kick to you 
It's over and for reeaal

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready 
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready

Let me be the one to enjoy you 
Let's kick it girl 


Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do,cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious,or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses
And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I""ll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Leagon of Doom


Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you til you run out of breathe
Then bust a nut all over yourself
The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Turn around, you down to ride
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey
And that's fo' sho'


What's the buiseness baby, can I get in them drawes
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'ma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?

Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night,
Planets are moving at the speed of light.
Climb up, up in the trees,
every chance that you get,
is a chance you seize.
How long am I gonna stand,
with my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop,
before I see things the right way up.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I got found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
to show you how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
if you could see it then you'd understand?

Ideas that you'll never find,
All the inventors could never design.
The buildings that you put up,
Japan and China all lit up.
The sign that I couldn't read,
or a light that I couldn't see,
some things you have to believe,
but others are puzzles, puzzling me.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I got found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
to show you how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
if you could see it then you'd understand,
ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All those signs, I knew what they meant.
Some things you can invent.
Some get made, and some get sent,
Ooh?

But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at  your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment


And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya

Guardate la poesiaguardate la alegria pa ti
No pido que todos los dias sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tan poco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdon
Si lloras con los ojos secosy hablando de ella

Ay amor me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que te fueras sin decir a donde
Ay amor fue una tortura perderte
Yo se que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo se errores se aprende
Y hoy se que es tuyo mi Corazon
Mehor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas


Ay amor me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que no creas mas en mis promesas
Ay amor es una tortura perderte
Yo se que no hesido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivi yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que es tuyo Corazon
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios

No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Dejame el sabado a mi que es mejor
Que mi negra no me castigues mas
Porque alla afuera sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Soy como e lave que vuelve a su nido
Yo se que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estory hecho de carton
No solo de pan vive el hombra
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que es tuyo mi Corazon

Ay ay ay
Ay, todo lo que ht hecho por ti
Fue una tortura prederte
Me duele tanto que sea asi
Sigue llorando perdon
Yo…yo no voy
A llorar por ti

She had some trouble with herself

He was always there to help her

She always belonged to someone else


I drove for miles and miles

And wound up at your door

I've had you so many times but somehow

I want more


I don't mind spending everyday

Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

She will be loved


Tap on my window knock on my door

I want to make you feel beautiful

I know I tend to get insecure

It doesn't matter anymore


It's not always rainbows and butterflies

It's compromise that moves us along

My heart is full and my door's always open

You can come anytime you want


I don't mind spending everyday

Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

She will be loved


I know where you hide

Alone in your car

Know all of the things that make you who you are

I know that goodbye means nothing at all

Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I cant be denied I can lie im on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side andale arriba
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be your keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter


I was gone for a minute but now im home,
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone,
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome,
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone,
Let my spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet,
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so saucy and I get respect,
You don't have to look no farther, you dealin with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

2005,64,Incomplete,Backstreet Boys,,"Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on, but I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State wanna see my need
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town


Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin shit
You be rappin bout blow I was movin the shit
You talkin bout shootin out and I was doin the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm true to be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine


Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin..

2005,68,Best of You,Foo Fighters,Alternative rock,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh...

Oh...Oh...Oh...Oh...

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?

I felt a revelation coming around
I guess its right, it's so amazing
Everytime I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in
A soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
When mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from

I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you

Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

Guess I'm still in love with you
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

Guess I'm still in love with you
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I know that the fault is mine
'Cuz I let him go

I be back for more
Everybody's on the floor
Goin', goin' outta control

Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set if off

Sick with it boy, better get wit it what
In the club, I get it goin' goin' uhh
Just move it to the music its on
To the sound of 50 and D-R-E
Everythings calculated in time percised
Never move another mill let's get right aight
Success is my drug of choice I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do
Hit the dance floor, move how you wanna move
Later on, we can cruise if you wanna cruise
Its whatever you want, the fact is I got more than I flaunt

I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control

Set it off from your left dawg
Set if off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off

System thumpin', dance floor jumpin'
We thirty deep in this bitch, we stuntin'
Thats what you get, you in my hood
I thought you understood
You know me, VIP, no ID
Bottles in DP, I do it real BIG
Bitches break their necks to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstacy without ecstacy
I'm the chef, you need a hit, I got the recipe
Doc got the antedote and send the drugs in the nose
Can you feel it, Em said for me to make ya feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest

I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control

Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off

I'm hot boy, I'm burnin' up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tounge
Till the speakers all blown we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayn
Shorty, hit me high, then hit me low
Get to poppin' and shakin' that thang on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
No body put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, its the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I'll stay with it
Hit the telly, play wit it, in a major way get it

I did my thang in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dance floor, jam-packed
I got 'em goin', goin' outta control

Set if off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off nigga I said set it off

Or where ever we should meet

2005,80,These Words,Natasha Bedingfield,Pop,"Hab ein paar Akkorde zusammengeschmissen

Die Kombination D-E-F

ist, was ich bin, was ich mache

Niemand wird das für dich erledigen

Versuche, mich zu konzentrieren

Aber ich fühle mich so richtig ausgetickt

Ich brauch ein bisschen Hilfe, etwa Inspiration

Aber die kommt nicht so einfach

Woah oh


Bridge:

Versuche, die Magie zu finden

Versuche, einen Klassiker zu schreiben

Weißt du das nicht, weißt du das nicht?

Weißt du das nicht?

Der Mülleimer ist voller Papier

Kluge Reime, bis später


Refrain:

Diese Worte sind mein eigen

Die fließen aus meinem Herzen

Ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich

Es gibt keine andere Möglichkeit

Es besser zu sagen als mit

Ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich...


Hab etwas Byron, Shelley und Keats gelesen

Die Verse hab ich mit HipHop-Beats

Unterlegt und vorgetragen

Ich hab schwierigkeiten damit

Das zu sagen was ich meine

Mit toten Dichtern

Und elektronischem Schlagzeug

Ich weiß, dass ich für eine gewisse Zeit

Das Tonstudio gebucht habe

Aber ich konnte keinen Super-Refrain finden

Jetzt bist du weg und hast die Messlatte gleich höher gelegt

Nichts, was ich schreibe, ist jemals gut genug


Refrain...


Steige von meiner Bühne

Die Vorhänge werden weggezogen

Kein ""HyperBowl""-Spiel

Hinter dem ich mich verstecken kann

Meine nackte Seele wird entblößt

Woah, oh, oh, oh. Woah oh


Bridge...


Refrain...


Ich liebe dich - ist das ok?

2005,84,As Good as I Once Was,Toby Keith,Country,"She said, ""I'e seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my
Name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
And you're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
We'll put a big Texas smile on
Your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime

When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend dave
Ive known him since we were kids at school
Last night he
Had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great
Big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand.""
I said, ""Dave,""

I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime

When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess thouse boys dont look all that
Tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""

But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can

I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff

I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
Maybe not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath

OOOh
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you

OOOh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me,
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me


OOOh
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction

OOOh
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get to steppin'


If you can't make me say OOO
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want none
If you can't make me say OOO
Like the beat of this groove

You don't have no business in this here's your papers
Baby you are dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed

2005,87,Ordinary People,John Legend,Soul,"Girl, I'm in love with you

The same to honeymoon, passs the infatuation fate

Right in the thick of love

At times we're sick of love

It seems like we aruge everyday

I know I misbehaved

And you made your mistake

And we both still got room left to grow

And though love sometimes hurts

I still put you first

And we'll make the things work

But I think we should take it slow


We're just ordinary people

We don't know which way to go

'Cause we're just ordinary people

Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow


The same to movie

No fairytale conclusions are

It gets more confusing everyday

Sometimes it's heaven sent

Then we head back to hell again

We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up your call

We rise and we fall

And we feel like just walking away

As all love advances, we take second chances

Though it's not fair to see I still want you to stay


We're just ordinary people

We don't know which way to go

'Cause we're just ordinary people

Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow


Maybe we'll live and learn

Maybe we'll crash and burn

Maybe you stay, maybe you leave, maybe you return

Maybe in another find, maybe we won't survive

Maybe we'll grow and never know

Baby, you and I

We're just ordinary people

We don't know which way to go, yeah

'Cause we're just ordinary people

Maybe we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people

We don't know which way to go

'Cause we're just ordinary people

Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow, slow

This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

But she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

And when she sees it's me
On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringin' in my head
Still ringin' in my head

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more

Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
Oh, I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for

I'm lookin' for

""Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me - I SAID""

Mike Jones!!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 80 4's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 0, eight zero zero 4
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was here, shea
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was here, shea
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was here, shea - because


I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin laid in the shade
2 slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryin to call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' whole ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same


Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick

just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for

Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

And I'm takin everythang with me... 
Well it all come down to her...

2005,96,Chariot,Gavin DeGraw,,"Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon ohhhh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me

Oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your:
Strength

Remember seeking moons rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
From bringing back
More than a memory


You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

2005,98,Mississippi Girl,Faith Hill,Country,"Well it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage i'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul I know that I'm the same way
That I really always been

Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all I'm still a Mississippi girl

Well I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah

Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all I'm still a Mississippi girl

Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways

2005,99,Number One Spot,Ludacris,Comedy hip hop,"Yeahhhh baby, heh heh, yeahh!

It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look

I'm never goin nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

I'm comin for that number one spot!

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars


Causin lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin to get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!

Girl give me that pussy 
Girl give me that

She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds 
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown

Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things 
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change 
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars 
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars 
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split 
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit 
She still looking tight though 
Still built right though 
Run my game right and after the club 
She might go back to the telly with me 
Shake her jelly with me 
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me

Don't stunt now take off your shoes 
Don't act confused you know what time it is 

Girl give me that pussy 
Girl give me that

2006,1,Bad Day,Daniel Powter,Pop,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day


Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day

If you lookin' for her in the day time in the light

She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on

All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving 
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa

Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan 
My will and self restraint 
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
No more do we snatch ropes 
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats 

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I am on tonight and my hips don't lie

The attraction, the tension

2006,7,Crazy,Gnarls Barkley,Neo soul,"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind 
There was something so pleasant about that phase. 
Even your emotions had an echo 
In so much space 

And when you're out there 
Without care, 
Yeah, I was out of touch 
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough 
I just knew too much 

Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Probably 

And I hope that you are having the time of your life 
But think twice, that's my only advice 
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are, 
Ha ha ha bless your soul 
You really think you're in control 

Well, I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
I think you're crazy 
Just like me 

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb 
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them 
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun 
And it's no coincidence I've come 
And I can die when I'm done 

Maybe I'm crazy 
Maybe you're crazy 
Maybe we're crazy 
Probably

They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
My music so loud
I'm swangin
They hopin that they gon catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty

Police think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the playstation controller is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies
Rock clean itself so I pull in ladies
Laws of patrolling you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin to jack for some
But we packin somethin that we have and um will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin oak
Music loud and tippin slow
Twist and twistin like hit this dough
Pull up from behind and is in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution
CDs change niggas like who is that producing?
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losin


I been drinkin and smokin holdin shit cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curve man
Nigga been sippin on that Hennessey and the gin again is in again we in the wind
Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin another one up, we livin like we ain't givin a fuck
I got a revolver in my right hand, 40 oz on my lap freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all
Comin pretty deep, me and my do-jo
I gotta get back to backstreets
Wanted by the six pound and I got heat glock glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark, but well if you want, nigga you poppin dark
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire


Do what you thinkin so, I tried to let you go
Turn up a blink of light and I swang it slower
A nigga upset for sure cause they think they know that they catchin me with plenty of the drink and dro
So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin
Cause they denyin is racial profiling
Houston, TX you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you then I'mma have to cruise I'm in number two on some more DJ Screw
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin them WE HATE YOU
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'mma 'bout to pull up at your home and it's on

People start off as a phase

Now from top to bottom
See baby we been...

Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel

But still I wanna ask you
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby

And if you got it deep in your heart
Ladies let him know he's got you locked
Look him right in his eyes and tell him

2006,13,Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,Pop rock,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head

Gotta fix that calender I have 
That's marked July 15th 
Because since there's no more you 
There's no more anniversary 
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you 
And your memory 
And how every song reminds me 
Of what used to be 

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears 
So done with wishing you were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow

Dont make me think about her smile 
Or having my first child 
Let it go

What in the world was your confidant take me for

Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana

Coming everyway saying baby what cha gonna
Looking down the barrel of a hop and a forty five

Just another way to survive

A little lonely she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death

To true to say good bye to you
To true to say, say, say

One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minesota
North Dakota man was a gunning for the quota

Down in the valley she was saving the best for last

2006,26,What Hurts the Most,Rascal Flatts,Country pop,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m ok
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still Harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

What hurts the most
Is being so close

2006,27,How to Save a Life,The Fray,Pop rock,"Step one you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Somewhere along in the bitterness
Had I known how to save a life

2006,28,Unfaithful,Rihanna,Pop,"Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company


Hes more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true


And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying


I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer


As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss up on my cheek
He's here reluctantly
As if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well


Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Honey why are you crying is everything okay 
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud 
Well, my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those words it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 

It's funny that you're calling me tonight 
And yes I've dreamt of you too 
And does he know you're talking to me 
Will it start a fight 
No I don't think she has a clue 
Well my girls in the next room 
Sometimes I wish she was you 
I guess we never really moved on 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those wordsa it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name 
It sounds so sweet 
Coming from the lips of an angel 
Hearing those words it makes me weak 
And I never wanna say goodbye 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 
But girl you make it so hard to be faithful 
With the lips of an angel 
Honey why are you calling me so late

2006,31,Everytime We Touch,Cascada,Eurodance,"I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me. 
I still feel your touch in my dreams. 
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why. 
Without you it's hard to survive. 

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling. 
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. 
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. 
I need you by my side. 
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. 
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky. 
Can't you feel my heart beat so 
I can't let you go. 
I want you in my life. 

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky. 
They wipe away tears that I cry. 
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all. 
You make me rise when I fall. 

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling. 
And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. 
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. 
I need you by my side. 
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. 
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something 'bout you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside

I don't know what you did boy but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

Told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
That every time I see you
Everything starts making sense


CHORUS:
Ain't no other man
That can stand, up next to you
Ain't no other man
You're the kinda guy

What was cloudy now is clear, yeah yeah
You're the light that I needed, uh

You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on giving it up

'Cause I want everyone to know
That you are mine and no one else's, ohh, oh OOH!

Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other

2006,38,Photograph,Nickelback,Post-grunge,"Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if It's too late
Should i go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it

So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
Everytime I do it makes me

2006,39,Because of You,Kelly Clarkson,Pop,"I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you

2006,43,Where'd You Go,Fort Minor,Alternative hip hop,"Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.

She said ""Some days I feel like shit,
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone,
I get along but the trips always feel so long,
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone,
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone,
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call,
But when I pick up I don't have much to say,
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
Me and the rest of the family here singing ""Where'd you go?""

I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone,
Please come back home...

You know the place where you used to live,
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile,
But now, you only stop by every once in a while,
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time,
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way,
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say,
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
Me and the rest of the family here singing ""Where'd you go?""

I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone,
Please come back home...

I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless,
It seems one thing has been true all along,
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone,
I guess I've had it with you and your career,
When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it...

Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,

Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away

Just walk away

I wanna love
I want a fire
To feel the burn
My desires
I wanna man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't then just leave

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away

If you don't have the answer
Walk away
Just walk away
Then just leave

On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And oh I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin'

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh I scream for you
Come please I'm callin'
And all I need from you

2006,50,Don't Forget About Us,Mariah Carey,Pop,"Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy...

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now everytime I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best 
And don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it 
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny
So baby we just can't let 
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about


And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be MC

Baby don't you, don't you forget about us


Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go

When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us.

Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know,
you know, you know


So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go

Keep breathing

Hold on to me and, never let me go

2006,54,What's Left of Me,Nick Lachey,Soft rock,"Watch my life,
Pass me by,
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

Yeah...

Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken,
And I'm faded,
I'm half the man I thought I would be:
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside,
Little by little,
No where to go,
But going out of my mind
In endless circles,
Running from my self until,
You gave me a reason for standing still


It's falling faster,
Barely breathing,
Give me something,
To believe in
Tell me: It's not all in my head

Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again


I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out of my mind
Out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left of me?

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
Bobby Creek

I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby creek is in the place
The name is snoop too
My drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I hit you in ya ?
Come sip on my gumdrops

I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

Shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me

Obie Trice!

One slug
Couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on these nuts
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
True I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night pass to the matinee
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me

It was all good at first,
Spending money, going shopping
Eating at the finest restaurants
And then from club hopping

She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I don't like
We didn't have a worry in the world, got u diamonds got u pearls
But I can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls
Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it
You got a good nigga on the side, you betta run wit it,
Even though I'm on tha road doing shows,
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her,
Guess u ain't understand,

Hey, give me time to put my bags down,
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fighting, let me leave,
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellas riding 'n' drinking
She's blowing my two way up but I need some time for thinking
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do
Look, let me ask ya'll
Should I stand tall, or let this relationship fall
I ain't down on with having my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up

Ta all the fellas know u feel me, if you ever had a woman,
Good times led to bad times n u ain't see it coming,
Tried your best to make her happy,
But it wasn't enough,
Cuz mama told me in relationship the road gets rough

Weak n stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route
Guess she ain't understand

No time to waste back to my place

That sassy tempo with that walk,
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me.

What ya body got a young boy ready to do.
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you,

2006,71,Who Says You Can't Go Home,Bon Jovi,,"I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I've been there, done that, I ain't lookin' that
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

Who says you can't go home
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and that's a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million mile of memories on that road
And every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known, 
who says you can't go home


I've been there, done that, I ain't looking that
It's been a long long road
Feels like I've never left, that's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go, 
who says you can't go home


It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessy I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute

Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it

My dough keep the scales tippin like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N

Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment

I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh

Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu

2006,78,"Jesus, Take the Wheel",Carrie Underwood,Country,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It would been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this all on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh

2006,82,Hate Me,Blue October,Alternative rock,"If your dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me.)

I was just calling to see how you ware doing.
You sounded really uptight last night.
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too.
I just wanted to make sure you were really OK,
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication.
You know I love you, and...
Take care honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure.
See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you. Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for 3 whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again
In a sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping, are you dreaming,
if you're dreaming are you dreaming of me.
I can't believe you actually picked me

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

Nothing to lose

Just went out my head

2006,87,Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,Jazz rock,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

2006,90,When I'm Gone,Eminem,Conscious hip hop,"Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two

I want to talk to you for a minute.

It seems we have so much in common yeahh,

I cant wait until I see your face again

There aint no telling where this love could end up
There aint no telling where this love could end up

Just enjoy each other company

I guess thats why aaaa

There aint no telling where this love could end up

Hey shorty why you gotta act like that, I'm saying
I'm just trying to be nice to you

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that..aye-aye

Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo space
Selling niggaz is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get yo knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like faith, make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad I'm making you stay


Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it yo chest
Take advantage of what your concealing in yo dress
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with yo panties so wet


This nigga playing mind games man
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move
Yo best move, keep it pimpin' you understand...hey
I mean you know what I'm saying I don showed you how I feel
You know what I'm saying, I put myself all the way out there you know
The ball in yo court man, but I just got a question for you...
Is you happy??

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Disease's growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disasters all around
World despaired
Your only concern
Will they fuck up my hair

Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my head and suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty would you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my head and suck it girl, stupid girl!



Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that,

They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You wont get out the county, 'cos you're damn ass free
You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I dont get sleep, no..

Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Lining them up-a like ass cracks,
Ladies, homies, at the track
its my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
watch me as I gravitate
hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
this motown,

Cant fight with us
With yo sound

With nobody tellin me what I'm gonna do 
And I'm feeling so free... 
With nobody but me... 
Now I can handle all my business 
All my fellas can I get a witness 
But I'm feelin kinda lonely 
On top of that I'm kinda horny 
And I gotta get back to her... 
Now I'm leavin quickly... 
Before she come and try to get me... 
And I'm takin everythang with me...

2006,99,Do I Make You Proud,Taylor Hicks,Soul,"I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud

I guess I’ve learned
To question is to grow,
That you still have faith,
Is all I need to know,
I’ve learned to love,
Myself in spite of me,
And I’ve learned to
Walk on the road I believe.

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved
Everybody need to rise on
Everybody needs to be loved, to be loved

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
This is what we dream about
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been
Never been afraid of standing out

Do I make you proud
Do I make you proud

Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank

We fly higher than weather
And G5's are better, You know me,
an anticipation, for precipitation. Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

Girl I'm asking could you be my queen?
A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share
Because

When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever

There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end

If I could escape & recreate a place that's my own world

I want to get away, to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah

You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy, waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanted you with me

If I could escape & recreate a place that's my own world
We can make it better

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school 
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me.

Say it right
Say it all
You either got it
Or you don't
You either stand or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
Do you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me

I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonite you tonite

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really want to go?

2007,13,Makes Me Wonder,Maroon 5,Alternative dance,"I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
So this is goodbye

God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
And I...and so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you anymore
Anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like tabo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down

Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!

I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

Get a lil drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure medicure kitty-cat claws

Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like ""yoo""
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
""Akon!""

I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like tabo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing ""D!""
Hitting on less than ""Three!""

Wanna see you work your body

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling, I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV, ""Just let me clear the air...""
We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right you wasn't there
If se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-it-it
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
Cause our run will never be over, not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
Wanna see you work your body



... club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
Wanna see you work your body

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody

Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma i fell in love again
It's safe to say i have a new girlfriend

And i know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And i'm afraid i might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then i don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know i'm young but if i had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun


Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

It's been awhile since we talked last and i'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad i'm finally thinkin' i may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And i know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But i promise this is on a whole new plane

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone

It's gonna be a long drive home but i know as soon as i arrive home
And i open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there
Man i swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song
But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh i ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word
And i would still cherish every moment
And when i start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere i go i keep her picture in my wallet like you

Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

Take a look at my girlfriend
Not much of a girlfriend

2007,24,How to Save a Life,The Fray,Pop rock,"Step one you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Somewhere along in the bitterness
Had I known how to save a life

2007,25,Home,Daughtry,Rock,"I'm staring out into the night,
Trying to hide the pain.
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing.
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain.

Well I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old,
So I'm going home.
Well I'm going home.

The miles are getting longer, it seems,
The closer I get to you.
I've not always been the best man or friend for you.
But your love, it makes true.
And I don't know why.
You always seem to give me another try.

So I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old,
So I'm going home.
I'm going home.

Be careful what you wish for,
'Cause you just might get it all.
You just might get it all,
And then some you don't want.
Be careful what you wish for,
'Cause you just might get it all.
You just might get it all, yeah.

Oh, well I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old.
I said these places and these faces are getting old,
So I'm going home.

Now little lisa is only 9 years old 
Shes tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why shes all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody will listenin
Mama is on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with laughs--usually endin in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but some get some clothes and pack
She says shes bout to run away and never come back.


Little nicole is only 10 years old
Shes steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
Its only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight til the end
Until one day lil stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but some get some clothes and pack
She says shes bout to run away and never come back.


Little erica is eleven years old
Shes steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops x to get rid of all the pain
Cause shes havin sex with a boy whos sixteen
Emotions run deep and she thinks shes in love
So theres no protection hes usin no glove
Never thinkin bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he aint ready for a kid
Knowin her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say shes about to run away and never come back.

2007,36,Rockstar,Nickelback,Country rock,"I'm through with standing in line 
to clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth 
and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out 
quite the way I want it to be

I want a brand new house 
on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough 
for ten plus me

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club 
At thirty-seven thousand feet

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and 
James Dean is fine for me

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
With her bleach blond hair

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs 
So I can eat my meals for free

I think I'm gonna dress my ass 
with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to 
blow my money for me

I'm gonna trade this life 
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair 
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
With her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and 
today's who's who
They'll get you anything 
with that evil smile
Everybody's got a 
drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs 
that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills 
from a pez dispenser
When they ask why I drink all day 
I'll say because I can

I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Then listen to the fans tell me how damn good I am

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

2007,41,Wait for You,Elliott Yamin,Pop,"
I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you 
& I'm wishing that you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone, 
Girl you could have stayed 
but you wouldnt give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more then i can stand
And all my tears they keep running down my face
Why did you turn away?


So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me? 
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you wanted to be


So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you


It's been a long time since you called me
How can you walk away,
Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby
What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me, your still in love with me
Don't leave me crying.


Baby why can't we just start over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But your telling me it wont be enough


So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true
I really need you in my life
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you


So why does you pride make you run & hide
Are you that afriad of me?
But I know it's a lie what your keeping inside
Thats not how you wanted to be

Baby I will wait for you
Baby I will wait for you
If it's the last thing i do


Baby I will wait for you
Cause I don''t know what else i can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just aint true

But shawty we burn it up.


Beside every great man, you can find a woman like a soldier holdin' him down.

And she treats me like a Don, watches for the hit.
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with.
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip.
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip.
Middle fingered anybody who hate the,

2007,47,Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,Jazz rock,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And I'm singing

Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen, I, I'm alive
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive


And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died...


We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day

2007,57,Because of You,Ne-Yo,R&b,"Want to, but I can’t help it
I love the way it feels,
It’s got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don’t
Tell myself I’ll stop everyday, knowin’ that I wont

I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don’t know if I walk away of it, but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know that much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, i’m so strung out on you
Babyboo, but I like it

And it’s all because…
Never givin’ up,
She’s the sweetest touch

Think of it every second
I thinkin of it but, 
Only concern is the next time, I’m gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cuz she’s no good for me
I tried and tried but my obsession wont let me leave

I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don’t know if I walk away of it, but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know that much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, i’m so strung out on you
Babyboo, but I like it

And it’s all because…
Never givin’ up,
She’s the sweetest touch

Over you, over you, over you

Because of you,

2007,59,Welcome To The Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,Emo,"When I was,
A young boy,
My father, took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son when you grow up, will you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons, and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made? Because one day, I'll leave you, a phantom, to lead you in the summer, to join the black parade.""

When I was,
A young boy
My father, took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son when you grow up, will you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling, she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the street
And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on, We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
Until my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
You're misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Lets shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on

We'll carry on,
And though your dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though your broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
And on we carry through the fears
Oh oh oh

The disappointed faces of your peers
Oh oh oh
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die
You’ll never make me
Go and try; you’ll never break me
I won’t explain, or say I’m sorry
Give a cheer, for all the broken
Listen here, because it’s who we are
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero
I
Don't
Care

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though your broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
Do or die
You’ll never make me
Go and try; you’ll never break me
I won’t explain, or say I’m sorry
Give a cheer, for all the broken
Listen here, because it’s who we are
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero)
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
We'll carry on

Anything 
Or anyone 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? 

I don't quite know 
How to say 
How I feel 

Those three words 
Are said too much 
They're not enough 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? 

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads 

I need your grace 
To remind me 
To find my own 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? 

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

All that I am 
All that I ever was 
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see 

I don't know where 
Confused about how as well 
Just know that these things will never change for us at all 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

They start in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

What am I going to say
When you make me feel this way
I just mmmmm

And they start in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

And it starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
'cause you make me smile baby
Just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever wherever wherever you go
Wherever wherever wherever you go

wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while

2007,69,Who Knew,Pink,Pop,"You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh
That's right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no
No no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
'fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better
Still you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Yeah yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we
Until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend

2007,70,Never Again,Kelly Clarkson,Pop rock,"I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when your in bed with her, you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell, by the flames that burned your words

I never read your letter
'Cos I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all OK

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you were doing
And don't say, you simply lost your way
She may believe you but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you were doing
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never

Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you were doing
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will
I never will
I never will

2007,79,Walk Away (Remember Me),Paula DeAnda,,"I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

You gonna remember me boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shhh.. we used to do
You was doing to much
I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying
You got a man anyway
I can't explain it neither
I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell ya its hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on
Before I could say

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question
Does she rub you feet
When you've had a long day
Scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids
Does she know that you like too
Play PS2 till 6 in the morning
Like I do

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away
You're gonna remember me)
Walk Away, Walk Away
You're gonna remember me)

I can't forget how we used to be
Our life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
But no other man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play
Show up on my doorstep
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say hey baby I love you
Like you used to

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away
You're gonna remember me)
Walk Away, Walk Away
You're gonna remember me)

I'm Gonna Remember You
Your Gonna Remember Me
The things we did
The way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me
My friend, my love, my family
How did we loose a love that seemed meant to be
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I'm missing and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

Walk Away, Walk Away

Your Gonna Remember Me)

So hard to express this feeling
Cause nobody compares to you
And you know she'll never love you like I do

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away

You're gonna remember me)

Walk Away, Walk Away

Remember You

You're gonna remember me)

You're gonna remember me)

You've got to open up, and let it all in 
But see, once it gets in, the poppin' begins 
And then you find out, why all the boys stare 

They're trying to bite our style 
Trying to study our approach 
They like the way we do it, so original 
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room 
This beat is for the clubs, and cars that go 

Everytime the bass bangs, realize it calls your name

We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide

Looking at you,holding my breath,
For once in my life,I'm scared to death,
I'm taking a chance,letting you inside.

Feeling alive all over again,
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says
For the first time
Maybe I'm wrong,
But I'm feeling right where I belong
With you tonight
Like being in love
To feel for the first time

The world that I see inside you
Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming
Reality in your eyes

Looking at you,
Holding my breath,
For once in my life
I'm scared to death,
I'm taking a chance,
Letting you inside.

As deep as the sky under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time

Where I belong with you tonight
Like being in love to feel for the first time

Into the unknown
We're lost in this
But it feels like home

Damn 
But Imma go ahead and talk about it 
Listen 


I'm sitting looking out the window like damn 
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand 
You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be, 
Me all on yo mind and I'm knowing that it couldn't be 
Cause you ain't call and I ain't even appalled 
I still got allot of pain I ain't dealt wit it all 
I been running round with other chicks, I'm single and they loving it, I'm liking it but I just want the
one that I was in love with. 
That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you know I can't, 
Get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know. 
You got a hold or some kind of control of me 
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me 
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever Instead
of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather, damn I gotta pull myself together 
Cause... 


When I'm with somebody, all I think bout is you 
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do 
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
to get you outta my system. 
It's so hard to get you outta my system. 


I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back 
When I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me 
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me 
It's too major, don't see you on my pager, 
The fellas telling me 'just let her go Bow', believe me, I'm trying man, I just don't know how 
I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots, knowing they just want me cause I'm in the top spot 
That's not poppin and my brain aint stopping, thinking 
Who she with, or where she going, is she club hoppin? 
I never had this kind of problem in my life, this is my first time dealing with this kind of fight 
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight, 
Damn this aint even right, cause... 


I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
It's so hard to get you outta my system. 


Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day 
Can you feel me? 
I been tryna get you off my mind, but I cant after all this time 
That's what kills me 
Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day 
Can you feel me? 
I been tryna get you off my mind, but I cant after all this time 
And it kills me 


When I'm with somebody, all I think bout is you 
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do 
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
So hard to get you outta my system 


I remember everything that me and you talked about 
And if I could, I would, turn back the hands of time and correct all my mistakes that I ever did 
But now I guess I gotta move on, right? 
It's still hard and I still love you till this day 
Peace.

And she's got everything that I have to live without

That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause


So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into..

Last chance for one last dance

Got me hard in the pants
Because she all in her stash, 
Doing her muthafucken dance man
Look, lil' buddy cute in the face
She rock her hips to the bass
She take a sip when she wave
And wanna get wit Lil'J
After she dance on that pole
I pull my cash so quick and fast
When that ass hit the floor

Now I got 32 flavas of that bootylious bubblegum
Raspberry, grape, cherry, 
Come and get this honey bun
Yummy-yum baby, not your ordinary lady
Known to drive the niggas crazy
Willy Wonka wanna pay me
On the daily
Off the hizzle
Rock my hizzle
Shake my skittle
Soda popping, watch it  sizzle
Man this shit right here the shizzle
Smoking on the hottest drizzle
Wanna taste it just a little
Rock my hips and make it wiggle
Wave and sipping in this bizzle


I like it when she show me she can
Rock it, roll it, drop it to the floor
Boucin' slow
Shorty's all pro 
That's the way to go
Jello booty ooo-wee
Got a nigga glacin' every time that - react 
""I thought I saw a putty cat""
Gimme, gimme, gimme dat
Fat cat, don't act on a pimp

You's a trip, girl, doing all them tricks
That's what's up
I like that shit a lot, come holla at a thug

A-towns finest I'm the top notch glamour chick
Tell me if I throw it at cha baby

'Cause the cause is Russian
If a hater wanna run they lip
Step up in the club and have them whispering
God-damn she thick
Take it to the bar
Hypnotic, and Hennessey is on my list
Seductive, look moving my body
Now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of that goose

Big boi pimping pop and dippin'

So a player start breaking in
Her muthafucken back like a playa suppose

She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare

2007,97,Better than Me,Hinder,Post-grunge,"I think you can do much better than me 
After all the lies I made you believe 
Guilt kicks in and I start to see 
The edge of the bed 
Where your nightgown used to be 
I told myself I wouldn't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you 
I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

While looking through your old box of notes 
I found those pictures 
That you were looking for 
If there's one memory I don't want to lose 
That time at the mall 
You and me in the dressing room 
I told myself I won't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you 
I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder 
Wish I never would've said it's over 
And I can't pretend that I won't think about you when I'm older 
Cause we never really had our closure 
This can't be the end 
I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 
I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me

2007,98,Paralyzer,Finger Eleven,Alternative rock,"I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
It’s been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I’m looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I’m still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

We’ll, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you 

I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move

Man we been messing with same girl.

See I met her at this party in ATLANTA!!
Well I met her at this party in CHICAGO!!
She came right up to me giving me conversation.
I said ""do you gotta a man?""
she said ""no"" with no hesitation.
Well, it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me.
At party all in my face while I'm laughing and buying her drinks
She whispered in my ear and said ""can you take me home?""
ME TOO!! Man she was in the Chi singing that same thing
Is that true?
And I thought it was true confessions when she said ""I LOVE YOU"".
Man I thought her body was calling when she said ""I WANT YOU"".
Look I even got some pictures on my phone.
Look at there. There she is with some boy shorts on.

She's the apple of my eye and your potential wife.
Man I just won't believe that we've been messing with the same damn girl.
Thought she was someone I could trust but she's been doubling up with both of us.

Said she got me on a ring tone
Are you talking about the pink phone?
Uh Uh
Man she told me that was turned off.
It's obvious that she's been playing us, playing us.
Constantly she's been lying to us, lying to us.
Don't like the way that she's been going 'bout, going 'bout.
What you think that we should do about it, about it?
Call her up at her home.
She won't know that I'm on the phone.
Yeah man that's the way.

Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack

Once or twice was enough 
And it was all in vain 
Time starts to pass 
Before you know it you're frozen 

But something happened 
For the very first time with you 
My heart melts into the ground 
Found something true 
And everyone's looking round 
Thinking I'm going crazy 

But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth

That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 

Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 

Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that the goal 
Is to keep me from falling 

But nothing's greater 
Than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me 
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe 

But I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I

And it's draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I'll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 

I don't care what they say 
I'm in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don't know the truth 
My heart's crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I

Take a fall, take a shot for you.

And you say...
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you...

It's too late to apologize.

2008,6,No Air,Jordin Sparks,Chamber pop,"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
If there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air 
No air, air 
No air, air
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

But how do you expect me 
to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air

And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
You made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands

I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better
Reason to write you a love song today

I learned the hard way
That they all say things you want to hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and
Your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better
Reason to write you a love song today

Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone
'cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that
There's a reason to
Write you a love song today

2008,13,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,Baroque pop,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.
I'm curious for you, caught my attention.

I kissed a girl and I liked it,
the taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl just to try it,
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
It felt so wrong,
it felt so right.
Don't mean I'm in love tonight.

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter.
You're my experimental game, just human nature.
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused, hard to obey.


Us girls we are so magical,
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable.
Hard to resist, so touchable.
Too good to deny it.
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent.

2008,25,Paralyzer,Finger Eleven,Alternative rock,"I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
It’s been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I’m looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I’m still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

We’ll, I’m not paralyzed

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I'll get what I'm asking for

No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger
Soul is in danger, I gotta let my spirit be free

To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on
And leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize, nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo

I'll always have you, I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could

Stop, admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I gotta be strong
And leave you behind


I'll always have you)

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
Still a part of me and you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything i do


Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you

When something is right
I feel like I must have known you
In another life
'cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes

Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breath
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said ""Oh she's just be a Miley""
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
Now I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the sign
That you can't wait to see me again

It's time to make our move, I'm shakin off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel...
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal... for the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can u see what I see

They're tryin to come back, all my senses push
Un-tie the weight bags, I never thought I could...
Steady feet, don't fail me now
Gonna run till you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down...

Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

2008,37,Live Your Life,T.I.,Hip hop,"You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are.
So live your life, ay ay ay.
instead of chasing that paper.
Ain't got no time for no haters.
No telling where it'll take you.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.

Never mind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful for after all the games I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, how much i think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them, In a crazy way.
Some say they so yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away.

You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay ay ay.
instead of chasing that paper.
Ain't got no time for no haters
No telling where it'll take you.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever having problems with, their record sales just holla tip.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
I do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what’s important with the positive.
And checks until your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarrayed, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay ay ay.
instead of chasing that paper.
Ain't got no time for no haters
No telling where it'll take you.
Cause I'm a paper chaser.

So live your life.

2008,41,Our Song,Taylor Swift,Country,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
And he says...


Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When you're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""man, I didn't kiss her, but I should have""
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything the day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said...


I've heart every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""man, I didn't kiss him, and I could have""
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I... wrote down our song

I missed you and things weren't the same
Cause everything inside it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry I'm blue, I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all you're sounds, and baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry:
This time I think I'm to blame it's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame
Every single day I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried it's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah sorry!

That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll be she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause


So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into..

2008,49,When I Grow Up,Pussycat Dolls,Electropop,"And you don't care what they say
See, everytime you turn around
They scream your name

Now I've got a confession
When I was young I wanted attention
And I promised myself that I’d do anything
Anything at all for them to notice me

But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what it's like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up
Be on TV
People know me
Be on magazines
When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it

They used to tell me I was silly
Until I popped up on the TV
I always wanted to be a superstar
And knew that singing songs would get me this far


Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it

I see them staring at me
Oh I'm a trendsetter
Yes this is true 'cause what I do, no one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me, and I know you want it

And how life was
Just you and me loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current slowly pulling me down
It’s getting harder too breath
It won’t be to long and I will be going under
Can you save me from this?

Cause it’s not my time I’m not going
There’s a fear in me it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I won’t go

I look ahead too all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I’m in a world that try to take them away
Oh but I’m taking them back
Cause all of this time I’ we been just too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friends is laughing and it’s not what we have
It’s what we be live in

Cause it’s not my time I’m not going
There’s a fear in me but it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it’s not my time I’m not going
There’s a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I won’t go
I won’t go

There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

But it’s not my time I’m not going
There’s a fear in me it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it’s not my time I’m not going
There’s a will in me and now it’s gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh

There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

But I won’t go
No I won’t go down

2008,53,Better in Time,Leona Lewis,Pop,"It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to 
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one
Thinking that I deserve it 
Now I realise that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I  know is I'm gon' be ok

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to 
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remaind me 
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in 
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gon' be ok

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to 
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go 
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be 
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to 
It'll all get better in time

I close both blinds and turn away

Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye's the only away

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay

Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

Some kill for the bill

Grind for the bill
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for some dub
Then triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy


She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... where my money at?

Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me

Some live for the bill
She whine for the bill

So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming

One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why 
On step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused, you got it all figured out
Everything that you wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

We live and we learn to take 
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why 
On step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why 
On step at a time

One step at a time

And I cant stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile

You wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
Can't remember what you did

But I hate...
You know exactly what to do
So that I cant stay mad at you 
For too long thats wrong

But I hate...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I dont want to fuss.. and fight no more
Said I despise that i adore you

But I just cant let you go 

You completely know the power that you have 
The only one makes me laugh

Said its not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I..will be under reason why
And it just aint right

And I hate how much I love you girl
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just cant let you go
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days maybe your magic wont affect me
And your kiss wont make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...

Youse a good lookin hottie, put yo' hands in the URR

Shorty hot, watch her rock, let me see that lolli pop
Body rock, don't you stop, I love the way that booty drop

Cherry lolli, chocolate lolli, I wanna see you pop that lolli

I sit here in this chair and I wish
for you not to leave me now.

not to make you my wife,
man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rolling,
me and you, we strolling,
they don't wanna come around.

2008,76,Crush,David Archuleta,Pop,"I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
There’s a rush, what a rush
Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me
It’s just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think
When you’re all alone
All that we can be
Where this thing could go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch your breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way I do
Cause I’m trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When were hangin, spending time girl,
Are we just friends
Is there more, is there more
See it’s a chance we’ve gotta take
Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever

Do you ever think
When you’re all alone
All that we can be
Where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch your breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way I do
Cause I’m trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away

Life doesn't always

Go my way, yeah...

I'm not a girl

Not yet a womam

All I need is time

A moment that is mine

While I'm in between 



I'm not a girl

There is no need to protect me

Its time that I

Learn to face up to this on my own

I've seen so much more than u know now

Don't tell me to shut my eyes


I'm not a girl

Not yet a woman

All I need is time

A moment that is mine

While I'm in between 


I'm not a girl

But if u look at me closely

You will see it my eyes

This girl will always find

Her way

2008,81,Love Story,Taylor Swift,Country pop,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashbacks starts
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""
Oh, ohh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in thy head, I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'""

Back your border when she knows someone crossed it,
Don't let nobody put you down, who your with
Take the pain of protecting your name, 
from the crutch to the cane to the highwire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when i met her,
Took my sweet time when i was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when i wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,

Out the many broken backdoors and windows,
Through the valley of the love of the lost,
Is a hole that is cut through the souls falling down 
from the thrones without leaving any windows,
But you drown in a piece for the moment,
The moment was over in time,
Then its gone the hit and run the tactless one has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when i met her,

Took my sweet time when i was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when i wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,

Gonna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach,
Now i know there's nothing we cant preach,
'cause the heart can't erase once it finds a place to be warm and welcome,
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when i met her
Took my sweet time when i was bitter

All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.

She don't believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit,
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me,
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it's been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum,
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights...

2008,92,7 Things,Miley Cyrus,Pop-punk,"One, two, three, four 

Sha, sha 

I probably shouldn't say this 
But at times I get so scared 
When I think about the previous 
Relationship we shared 

It was awesome, but we lost it 
It's not possible for me not to care 
And now we're standing in the rain 
And nothing's ever gonna change until you hear 
My dear 

The seven things I hate about you 
The seven things I hate about you 
Oh, you 

1. You're vain 
2. Your games 
3. You're insecure 
4. You love me, you like her 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy 
6. Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts 
I wanna be 
With the one I know 
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do 
7. You make me love you 

It's awkward, it's silent 
As I wait for you to say 
What I need to hear now 
Your sincere apology 

When you mean it, I'll believe it 
If you text it 
I'll delete it 
Let's be clear 

Oh I'm not coming back 
You're taking, seven steps here 

The seven things I hate about you 
1. You're vain 
2. Your games 
3. You're insecure 
4. You love me, you like her 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy 
6. Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts 
I wanna be with the one I know 
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do 
7. You make me love you 

and compared to all the great things 
That would take too long to write 
I probably should mention 
The seven that I like 

The seven things I like about you 
1. Your hair 
2. Your eyes 
3. Your old Levi's 
4. When we kiss, I'm hypnotized 
5. You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy 
6. Your hand in mine when we're intertwined... everything's alright 
I wanna be with the one I know 
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do 
You make me love you 

Sha, sha 
You do oh 

Ooh

2008,95,Feels Like Tonight,Daughtry,Alternative rock,"You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright.
You, you told me,
""Come and take a look inside.""
You believed me,
In every single lie.
But I, I failed you this time.

And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight,
Tonight.

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around.
I was chasing,
And nothing was all I found.
From the moment you came into my life,
You showed me what's right.

And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight.

I never felt like this before.
Just when I leave, I'm back for more.
Nothing else here seems to matter.
In these ever-changing days,
You're the one thing that remains.
I could stay like this forever.

And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight.
Tonight.
Tonight.
'Cause there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you.
And it feels like tonight.
Tonight.

2008,96,The Way I Are,Timbaland,Electro-pop,"I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we'll be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me

It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that love you best
Talk to me girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me

2008,99,Heaven Sent,Keyshia Cole,R&b,"Sent from heaven.
Sent from heaven.

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And it can't help who it loves
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been.
I don't wanna swing your change
And everything you used to say,
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And it can't help who it loves
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone

Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be the one

I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone

I wanna be the one who you believe
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
