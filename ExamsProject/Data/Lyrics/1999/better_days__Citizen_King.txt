In my shoes my toes are busted 
My kitchen says my bread is molded 
Got a good job at the dollar store 
One foot in the hole 
One foot gettin' deeper 
With a broken mirror 
And a blown out speaker 
I ain't got much else to lose 
I'm faded, flat busted 
Been jaded, I been dusted 
I know that I've seen better days 

One foot in the hole 
One foot gettin' deeper crank it to eleven 
And blow another speaker 
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose 

Cuz I've seen better days 
Been the star of many plays 
I've seen better days 
And the bottom drops out 

My cup's filled up with five buck wine 
Find myself here all the time 
Another rip in the glass 
Another chip in my tooth 
Rained on, I've been stained on 
Found another goat I put the blame on 
Now I'm steppin' on all the cracks 
But I guess there ain't no use 
I'm bent like glass second hand like glory 
Missed the bus but I'm in no hurry 
Molasses fast, no business born 

One foot in the hole 
One foot gettin' deeper crank it to eleven 
Blow another speaker 
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose 

Cuz I've seen better days 
Been the star of many plays 
I've seen better days 
And the bottom drops out 

I've seen better days 
Been the star of many plays 
I've seen better days 
And the bottom drops out
