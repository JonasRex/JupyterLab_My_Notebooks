Yo, See what I believe is,uh huh uh huh 808 needs a REMIX 
Oh Babe,is it true your girl don't do the things I do 
Are you missing this love I use to give to you 
Had ya coming in the front door,leaving out the back at night Oh Babe,Oh 
Babe Oh 
Babe do you stay up all night thinking how I did you right 
Are you missing all the ways I use to keep it tight 
I'm the only one that knows all the freaky things you like,Oh baby,Oh 
baby

Chorus:
She ain't got that boom like I do 
And she don't move the room like I do 
And she ain't got that junk in her trunk or the bump that you want 
And the girl ain't got the moves like I do 
And she ain't got that boom like I do 
And she don't move the room like I do 
And she don't put that curl in your toes when she makes her body roll 
And the girl don't work it slow like I do 

Babe,Is it true one day you called her my name 
It was then that you knew that it did'nt feel the same 
Down deep in your mind got you boning me again,Oh Babe,Oh Babe 
Babe don't pretend that your girls stuff is as good as mine 
If it was you would'nt be calling me all the time 
This love so good I'mthe first thing on your mind,Oh baby,Oh Baby 

Chorus

Yo ain't nobody bang it like me 
Stack it like me 
Would'nt like me 
Ask Kelly his orignal plan to get us large on that map by making you 
clap your hands 
Damns you bizotch 
I'm not gonna lie I bump my amps to this 
cutie pie honey bunch 
If your not busy take me to lunch 
Oh ya'll done did it now 
with the luscious music what poppin crews and 80 boost and what tellin

Forgets the mens cause the ride in my pocket baby and today I just wanna 
jiggle my ball and knock your socks off with
