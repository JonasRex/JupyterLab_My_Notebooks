Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, you know where
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes

[Mya]
Sittin' here thinkin 'bout our yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday

Ooh, where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So come on and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life, and dreams come true

[Repeat 2]

[Chauncey]
Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
Cuz you know that everything will be all right
I see the magic in your eyes
Strong enough, you know
To bring your dreams to life

Ooh, where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So come on and take my hand, to that special place
I don't want this dream to ever go away

Yo, don't touch that dial
You are now set for Y2K
Put this CD in your computer to hear the next song
And check us out on the Web
Nothing can fade us
Thank you
