Lullaby

She grew up with the children of the stars in the Hollywood hills and the boulevard 
Her parents threw big parties, everyone was there 
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper, Bob Seger, Sonny and Cher 
Now, she feels safe in the bar on Fairfax 
And from the stage I can tell that 
She can't let go and she can't relax 
And just before she hangs her head to cry 
I sing to her a lullaby, I sing everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
She still lives with her mom outside the city 
Down that street about a half a mile 
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty 
But she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while 
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown 
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town 
But, everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
I told her I ain't so sure about this place 
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face 
Seems like everyone here's got a plan 
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan 
But, everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Rockabye, rockabye
