Chante's got a man at home 
And he's sure good to me 

I'm sorry that your man ain't home 
I'm sorry that yours left you alone 
It's such a shame your man is playing games 
And I heard you say that men are all the same 
No, no, no 

1 - 	It's not the truth girl 
	Cause I got proof girl 
	Oh I got proof girl 
	I got a man at home 

2 - 	Chante's got a man at home 
	It hurts me your man's leaving you all alone 
	I can't help it that your baby's bad 
	Creeping out, cheating on ya, beating on ya 
	Chante's got a man at home 
	And he's sure good to me 

Listen 
Now why'd you let him beat you down 
No, no, what's up with that 
There's good men around 
Don't you know how beautiful you are inside girl 
And don't you let nobody go and steal your pride 
Oh no no, I know your thing girl 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 

I once was where you are 
Thought men were all the same 
But I never gave up hope 
And now my life has changed 
Listen to me girls 

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
He always treats me right, we never fight 
He sends me flowers and wines and dines me 
Took me home to meet his momma 
How he loves me 

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Give it one more try 
Before ya give up on love 

Repeat 2 until fade
