I've finally found the nerve to say  
I'm gonna make a change in my life starting here today  
I surrender all my love, I never thought I could  
I'm giving all my love away and there's only one reason that I would...  
And baby it's you  

The way you walk  
The way you talk  
The way you say my name and smile  
The way you move me  
The way you soothe me  
The way you sleep softly through the night  
Every morning you rise, and open your eyes  
I just wanna be there with you baby  
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth  

Next year lets call this day our Anniversary  
The day I put my heart in your hands and said that it was yours to keep  
From this moment on say that you'll always be mine  
'Cause girl when I'm alone with you there's only one thing that's on my mind...  
And baby it's you  

The way you walk  
The way you talk  
The way you say my name and smile  
The way you move me  
The way you soothe me  
The way you sleep softly through the night  
Every morning you rise, and open your eyes  
I just wanna be there with you baby  
Just wanna be yours, from this day forth.....
