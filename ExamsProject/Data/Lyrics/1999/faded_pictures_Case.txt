(feat. Joe)

[Case]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
That's right (oooo, yo, oooo, oh)
Life is funny, ain't it (yeahh, oh yeah)
Sometimes you can end up with (c'mon Joe, c'mon, ready)
Somebody you really don't wanna be with (no way, babe)
And others left to figure it out (oh, sing it for me Case)
Check it

She was more than a woman, a goddess for all it seems (is that right)
And all I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the grooving of love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

[1] - In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind (secret memories in her mind)
How could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time

(My heart is breaking, Oh)

[2] - Faded pictures in a broken glass
Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
Cuz it's breaking my heart
So won't you stare into the glass

(Joe help me out)

[Joe]
As she turned through the pages, the tears roll down her face
I could see her reminiscing why her life had to be this way
Then she stopped as she came to a page where her diary ends
To smell the scent of an old rose from her lover I suppose

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

The pictures keep spinning
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
Cuz she's lost inside the past

The pictures keep spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
Cuz she's lost inside the past
Lost inside the past

[Repeat 2 until fade]
