Yeah...I like it when the girls stop by.. In the summer 
Do you remember, Do you remember 
...when we met..That summer 

[Chorus]

New Kids On The block,had a bunch of hits 
Chinese food makes me sick. 
And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer,for the summer 
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch, 
I'd take her if I had one wish, 
But she's been gone since that summer.. 
Since that summer 

[Verse 1]

Hip Hop Marmalade spic And span, 
Met you one summer and it all began 
Your the best girl that I ever did see, 
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33 
When you take a sip you buzz like a hornet 
Billy Shakespere wrote a whole bunch of sonnets 
Call me Willy Whistle cause I can't speak baby 
Sumthin in your eyes went and drove me crazy 
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad, 
Left one day and never came back 
Stayed all summer then went back home, 
Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone 
Fell deep in love,but now we ain't speakin 
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton 
When I met you I said my name was Rich 
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch 

[Chorus]

New Kids On The block,had a bunch of hits 
Chinese food makes me sick. 
And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer,for the summer 
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch, 
I'd take her if I had one wish, 
But she's been gone since that summer.. 
Since that summer 

[Verse 2]

Cheery Pez,cold crush,rock star boogie 
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie, 
Always been hip to the B-boY Style 
Known to act wild and make girls smile, 
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl 
Remind me of you because you rock my world 
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow 
They drink lemonade and speak real slow 
You love hip hop and rock n roll 
Dad took off when you were 4 years old 
There was a good man named Paul Revere 
I feel much better baby when you're near 
You love fun dip and cherry Coke, 
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke 
When I met you I said my name was Rich 
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch 

[Repeat Chorus]

Bridge In the summertime girls got it goin on, 
Shake and wigle to a hip hop song 
Summertime girls are the kind I like, 
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike 

[Verse 3]

Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks 
My mind takes me back there oh so quick 
Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit 
Think about that summer and I bug,cause I miss it 
Like the color purple,macaroni and cheese, 
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees 
Call you up but whats the use 
I like Kevin Bacon,but I hate Footloose 
Came in the door said it before,I think I'm over you 
but I'm really not sure 
When I met you I said my name was Rich 
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch 
repeat Chorus 

[Bridge]

In the summer girls come and summer girls go 
Some are worth while and some are so so, 
Summer girls come and summer girls go 
Some are worth while and some are so so, 
Summertime girls got it goin on 
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song 
Summertime girls are the kind I like 
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike 

[Repeat Chorus]
