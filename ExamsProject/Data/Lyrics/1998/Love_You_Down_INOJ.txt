It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn dull for me
All that really mattered was you were my boyfriend
And baby that's all that matters to me

~Chorus~
Let me love you down, even if it takes all night
Let me love you down, you know it's got to be so right

Remember when you drove me home from work?
I loved the way when you kissed me bye
All of your friends think I'm just too young for you
So tell them that I can do what girls their age can do
Aw babe

[Chorus] 2x

It never really mattered too much to me
That they were just too damn blind to see
As long as I can love you down baby just be my man
That's all that matters to me

[Chorus]

Let me love you down
Ooh

Let me love you down,
I know, I know I could
Love you down, down, Ooh
Love you down, down, no no no no no no no
Let me love you, I wanna love you, down
Let me love you, I wanna love you, down baby
