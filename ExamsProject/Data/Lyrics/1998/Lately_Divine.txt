Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout u baby
(and everything u do)
just sittin away watching the days go by (2x)
have u ever felt a breeze hit your heart,
like the wind was blowing it apart
as you're spinning like a merry-go-round,
indications of a storm touching down
wish that i could weather any storm,
but i guess it was heart break from the norm
was a day i will always remember,
the saddest day in sweet november...
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout u baby
(and everything u do)
just sittin away watching the days go by (2x)
baby i'm on my knees praying God help me please,
bring my baby back, right back to me
if lovin you was right then i don't wanna go wrong
so i drown myself with tears,
sittin' here, singin' another sad love song
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout u baby
(and everything u do)
just sittin away watching the days go by (2x)
Lately i've been torn apart,
i wish you hadn't broke my heart
i'm missin' you babe,
missin you everyday
Lately i've been torn apart,
i wish you hadn't broke my heart
i'm missin' you babe,
missin you everyday
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout u baby
(and everything u do)
