You know that I want you babe
You know that I need you
You know that I love you
Just say it
Am I giving enough
Is it all that should be
When water gets rough
Will you still swim with me
So afraid to come close
And maybe too slow
And maybe too much
For you to consume

[CHORUS:]
And I wanna know if I
Could live inside you're world
And I wanna know if I
Could give it to you girl
You know that I wanna say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I love to say it
Our love just goes on and on and on
You know that I wanna say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on

I gave you all that you need
There's no better place you can be
And I know that in time
You will believe in me
So please hold out you're hand
And lets just changes golden band
'Cause I want you in my life
I want you to be my wife

[Repeat chorus]

My girl so special
I want to give it all to you
Loving you on and on
My girl so special
I want to give it all to you
Loving you on and on

[Repeat chorus]
