Finally I figured out, but it took a long long time
And now there's a turnabout, Maybe cause I'm trying


PRE-CHORUS 

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, They lead to you
I just can't turn, And walk away... 

CHORUS 

It's hard to say, What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always, Be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove, It's all for you 

I thought I'd seen it all, 'Cause it's been a long long time
But then we'll trip and fall, Wondering if I'm blind 

PRE-CHORUS   CHORUS 

Rain comes pouring down (Pouring down)
Falling from blue skies (Falling from blue skies)
Words without a sound, Coming from your eyes 

CHORUS - REPEAT ...
