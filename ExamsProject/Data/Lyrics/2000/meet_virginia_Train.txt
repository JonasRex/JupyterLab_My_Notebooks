She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess 
If you catch her stealin, she won't confess 
She's beautiful 
She never compromises, loves babies and surprises 
Wears hi-heels when she exercises 
Ain't that beautiful 
Meet Virginia 
Well she wants to be the Queen 
Then she thinks about her scene 
Pulls her hair back as she screams 
I don't really wanna be the queen 
Her daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors 
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President 
Well here she is again on the phone 
Just like me hates to be alone 
We just like to sit at home, and rip on the President 
Meet Virginia 
Well she wants to live her life 
Then she thinks about her life 
Pulls her hair back as she screams 
I don't really wanna live this life 
She only drinks coffee at Midnight, when the moment is not 
right, her timing is quite-unusual 
you see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic 
and the shape of her body - unusual 
Meet Virginia-I can't wait to 
Meet Virginia-Yea 
Chorus I   2
