Then let me show you now that I'm for real...
If all things in time, time will reveal...

Two... jus wanna be with you...
Three... girl its plain to see...that your the only one for me...
Four...repeat steps one to three...
Five... make you fall in love with me...
If ever I believe our work is done....then I start Back at One.(yeah)

So Incrediable...the way things work themselves out...
And all emotional, once you know that its all about babe...
And undesirable...for us to be apart...
Never would of made it very far...
Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
Cause...

One...your like a dream come true

Into this lonely heart of mine...
You threw out the life line...just in the Nick of Tiimmmeeee.....
