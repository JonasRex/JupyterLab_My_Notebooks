Girl i wish that i could spend time with you each and every day  
praying about my love and emotions that's the thing that's got me open and i  
don't know  
what it takes to let you know your my girl to let you know you're my baby  
and even when then they say we won't stay around  
if they only knew that we were meant to be together  
forever and ever whatever (there's no better thing)  
me and you girl that's why i write you love letters saying  

CHORUS: 
i like the way you look at me  
i like the time we spend baby  
i like what we have grown to be  
i like it girl don't you know i like it  
i like the way you look at me  
i like the time we spend baby  
i like what we have grown to be  
i like it girl don't you know i like it  

Sometimes i wanna be the one you be checking for can i get a second for me  
me and you to be alone tell me if you think it's wrong  
love is nothing but the time it takes you to say  i'm on your mind   
let me tell you i'm always there oh yeah  
let's get a little time away go to the movies on a saturday  
meet me at the finish line so i can tell you one more time  
girl you know i'm not scared to let you say that....  

CHORUS 

i like the way you look at me  
i like the time we spend baby  
i like what we have grown to be  
i like it girl don't you know i like it  
i like the way you look at me  
i like the time we spend baby  
i like what we have grown to be  
i like it girl don't you know i like it  

When i think of you  
i think of all the things we could do  
and i never wanna let  
you go and as long as i can let you know  
i hope we stay down forever
