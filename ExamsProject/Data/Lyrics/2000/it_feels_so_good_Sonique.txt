It Feels So Good

You always make me smile when I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe, I is totally bonafide, mmm
It's not the way you walk, and it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got, that keeps me satisfied

[chorus]Your love it feels so good, and that waht takes me high
Higher than I've been before and your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know, that your touch it means so much 
When I'm alone at night, it's you I'm always thinkin' of Ooh ooh baby

Oh won't you understand how I feel yeah deep inside
Uh huh, you made feel all I need to feel
Yes in my heart
[repeat chorus]
