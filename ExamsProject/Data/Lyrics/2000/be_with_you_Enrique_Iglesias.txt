Monday night I feel so low
Count the hours they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold 

Look out my windo to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I'm all alone

Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby just give me a sing

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with  you
Wanna be with you

I can't sleep and I'm up all night
Through these tears I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life

Don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you some how

[Repeat Chorus]

And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you

[Repeat Chorus]
