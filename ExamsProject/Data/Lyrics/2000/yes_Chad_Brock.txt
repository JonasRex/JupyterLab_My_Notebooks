(Chad Brock/Stephony Smith/Jim Collins)
She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Ohhhh how we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Ohhhh then I asked her can I see you again
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I wanna be
She's the one I long for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Ohhh then it happened one night looking in her eyes
Ohhh when I popped the question much to my sur-prize
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
So we called a preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since?
She said yes! and I said wow!  
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
