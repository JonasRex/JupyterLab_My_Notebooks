This is the story of a girl, 
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! 
And while she looked so sad in photographs, 
I absolutely love her, 
WHEN SHE SMILES!... 
How many days in a year 
She woke up with hope but she only found tears! 
And I can be so insincere, 
Making her promises never for real! 
As long as she stands there waiting, 
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes! 
How many days disapeer 
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose 
Your clothes never wear as well the next day! 
And your hair never falls in quite the same way! 
But you never seem to run out of things to say!... 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A GIRL, 
WHO CRIED A RIVER AND DROWNED THE WHOLE WORLD! 
AND WHILE SHE LOOKED SO SAD IN PHOTOGRAPHS, 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER, 
WHEN SHE SMILES!... 
How many lovers stay 
Just to put of with this shit day after day! 
(the last line was changed to
To put up with every day and all day! for the music video)
How did we wind up this way 
Watching our mouths for the words that we say. 
As long as we stand here waiting, 
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose! 
How do we get there today 
When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes! 
Your clothes never wear as well the next day! 
And your hair never falls in quite the same way! 
But you never seem to run out of things to say!... 
THIS IS THE STORY OF A GIRL, 
WHO CRIED A RIVER AND DROWNED THE WHOLE WORLD! 
AND WHILE SHE LOOKED SO SAD IN PHOTOGRAPHS, 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER, 
WHEN SHE SMILES!... 
This is the story of a - girl! 
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! 
And while she looks so sad and lonely there, 
I absolutely love her, 
WHEN SHE SMILES!... 
This is the story of a girl! 
Her pretty face she hid from the world! 
And while she looks so sad and lonely there, 
I absolutely love her, 
WHEN SHE SMILES! 
When she smiles!
