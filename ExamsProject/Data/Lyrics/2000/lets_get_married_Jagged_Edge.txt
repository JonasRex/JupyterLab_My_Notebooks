See first of all 
I know these so-called playas wouldn't tell you this
But I'm gonna be real and say what's heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah

When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Eho knew we'd make it this far
When I think about where we would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leving you

Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married

Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married

Said I done it all
But frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness

I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause making love to just anyone ain't happening
I just gotta be with you

Do you think about us finishing something we started so long ago
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about us maybe having some babies
Come on won't you be my lady forever,yeah

I'm ready to commit to you 
And I just can't wait for that night 
Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family

Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married
