Oooh,Yeahhhh,I'm wishin' on a fallin' star, 
wonderin' where you are....I wish... 

[Chorus]

I wish for you on a fallin' star,wonderin' 
where you are,do I ever cross your mind,In 
the warm sunshine,she's from the city of angels,like 
Betty Davis,James Dean,and Gable,never know 
what she means to me.I fell for the girl that's on TV. 

[Verse 1]

Met her at a counter affair,she wore a green dress,and 
everybody was there,felt out of place till she looked 
into my eyes.Shook your hand around 9 P.M. about 
never gonna be the same again.Never had to 
be on a movie screen to be the leading lady 
in all my dreams... 
Shooby-doo-wop,and scobby snacks,met a fly girl 
and i can't relax,the only problem is she's 
a movie star,Oh,my friends,they won't believe me,if 
they could only see me,at the risk of sounding 
cheesy,i think i fell for the girl on TV. 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Everybody knows her name,Wanna take a picture and 
their glad she came,But I just want to be there when 
she's down,down(Be there when she's down) 
I don't want her autograph,I just want to call her up 
and make her laugh,Never had to be on a movie 
screen,To be the leading lady in all my dreams. 
Shooby doo-wap & scooby snacks, 
I Met a fly girl and I can't relax 
The only problem is she's a movie star, 
Oh,My friends they won't believe me 
If they could only see me,At the risk of sounding 
cheezy,I think I fell for the girl on TV. 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]

I'm wishin' on a star....and wonderin' where you are 
Do i cross your mindIn the warm sunshine 

[Rich's Rap]

Yeah,So I wish for you on a bright shining star, 
Every where I look there you are,There you are 
It's the girl in the green dress, 
She took my breath away,And now I look to the sky, 
For a better day,To the beach shore and scooby snacks, 
I met a fly girl and I can't relax, 
Never had to be on a movie screen 
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams,I wish 

[Repeat Chorus]
