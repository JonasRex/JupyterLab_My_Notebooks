Faded
Written By Trevor Guthrie

When I get you all alone
I'm gonna move in nice and close
Ain't nobody gonna interrupt my game, oh no
Ever since you've been hangin' around
I've been trying to figure out
What I'm gonna say to you to get something, yeah

Couldn't we do what we did last night
Couldn't baby you and I be better friends
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further, oh yeah
Every night when we say goodbye 
how can I help looking in your eyes
Wondering why that you and I haven't hit it
Can we get it on

Chorus:
Kind of faded, but I'm feeling alright
Thinkin' about making my move tonight
I can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holdin' my body tight
'Cause I like the way you're making your move
I like the way you're making me wait
At the end of the night, I'm gonna make you feel like mine
You'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know you've got it?
And you know I want it
I can't wait to take you home (you know you've got it tonight)
I don't want to be rude at all
I just want to be where you go
Think that we could be alone? (yeah)

Couldn't we do what we did last night
Couldn't baby you and I be better friends
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further, oh yeah
Every night when we say goodbye
How can I help lookin' in your eyes
Wondering why that you and I haven't hit it
Can we get it on
