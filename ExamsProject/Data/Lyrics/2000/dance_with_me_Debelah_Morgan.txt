Dance With Me 


(Chorus)
Oh come and dance with me, my baby 
Let's dance, do it, go crazy 
The night is young and so are we 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Verse 1)
What I really wanna do 
Is just dance with you 
And feel your body tight 
Show ya how to do it right 
I can show you every move 
I know just what to do 
Each step we do is refine 
One dance and you'll be mine 

So baby when we hit the floor 
You'll be asking for more 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Chorus)
Oh come and dance with me, my baby 
Let's dance, do it, go crazy 
The night is young and so are we 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Verse 2)
Oh put your hand in mine 
Promise I'll take my time 
We'll dance from head to toe 
I can dance fast or slow 
Baby look into my eyes 
Let the music hypnotize 
Let our bodies synchronize 
When we're dancing you'll be mine 

So baby when we hit the floor 
You'll be asking for more 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Chorus)
Oh come and dance with me, my baby 
Let's dance, do it, go crazy 
The night is young and so are we 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Bridge)
Oh when it comes to dancing 
I know how to move 
When it comes to passion 
I know just what to do 
I feel the music inside 
I feel like I am alive 
Pretend I was right 
Let's make love 

(Chorus)

Oh come and dance 
Let's dance 
The night 
Let's make love and dance the night away 

(Chorus)X 4
