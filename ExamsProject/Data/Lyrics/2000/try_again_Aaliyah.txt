What would you do
To get to me
What would you say
To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again
If I hesitate
To let you win
Or would you be yourself
Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you stay

[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try it again

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try it again

I went to you 
You went to me
But I cant let it go
So easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Be eternity
Or just a week
Your chemistry
Is off the change 
Is perfect now
But will it change
This aint a yes
This aint a no
Just do your thang

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try it again

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try it again

[Hook]
If you dont wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
um, um, um, um

If you dont wanna throw it all away
You might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date
um, um, um, um
