If this world is wearing thin  And you're thinking of escape  I'll go anywhere with you  Just wrap me up in chains  But if you try to go alone  Don't think i'll understand   Stay with me stay with me  In the silence of your room  In the darkness of your dreams  You must only think of me  There can be no in between  When your pride is on the floor  I'll make you beg for more   Stay with me stay with me  You'd better hope and pray  That you make it safe  Back to your own world  You'd better hope and pray  That you wake one day  In your own world  'Cause when you sleep at night  They don't hear your cries  In your own world  Only time will tell if you can break the Sspell back in your own world   Stay with me stay with me Stay, stay with me  Stay...
