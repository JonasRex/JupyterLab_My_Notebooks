Look into my eyes Can't you see they're open wide Would I lie to you baby Would I lie to you Don't you know it's true Girl there's no one else but you Would I lie to you baby Would I lie to you  Everybody wants to know the truth In my arms is the only proof I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door Now it's open I can't do no more I'm telling you baby you will never find other girl In this heart of mine  Chorus  Everybody's got their history On every page a mystery You can read my diary you're in every line Jealous minds never satisfied I'm telling you baby you will never find another girl In this heart of mine  Chorus  When you wanna see me night and day If I tell you that I'm here to stay Do you think I give my love away That's not the kind of game I play I'm telling you baby you will never find another girl In this heart of mine  Chorus
