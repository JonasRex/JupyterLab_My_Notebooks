Many say that I′m too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from, yeah
But you will see it′s just a matter of timeMy love will surely make you mine

Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seems so uptight
But nothing′s wrong
And it′s alright with (nothing's wrong, it′s alright), my man (my man)

I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on with my man
People out there can understand
I'm givin′ him somethin' he can feel

Ooh, to let him know this love is real (hey)
Givin′ him somethin' he can feel (oh my love)
To let him know this love is real (oh my love is real)
This love is real

So much joy for us, it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
And that's exactly why I′m singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true
You tell me what does it mean?

Livin′ in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight, hey
Nothing's wrong
It′s alright (alright), my man (my man)

I like the way we carry on
His lovin' will send me on and on with my man
People out there, can you understand?
That I′m givin' him somethin′ he can feel

To let him know this love is real (that I'm giving love, giving, giving love)
Givin' him somethin′ he can feel (nah-nah, nah-nah, yeah, yeah, talk to me)
To let him know this love is real (I gotta let him know that this love′s stronger)
This love is real

Givin' him somethin′ he can feel (givin' him, givin′ him, givin' him, givin′ him)
Givin' him somethin' he can feel (givin′ him, givin′ him, givin' him, give him love)
Givin′ him somethin' he can feel (so sweet to me, so sweet to me, baby yeah)
Givin′ him somethin' he can feel (oh, baby, baby, whoo!)
Givin′ him...
