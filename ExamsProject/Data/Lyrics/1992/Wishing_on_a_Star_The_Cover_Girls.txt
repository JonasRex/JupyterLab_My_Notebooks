I′m wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I′m wishin' on a dreamTo follow what it means

I'm wishin′ on a star
To follow where you are
I′m wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows
That I see
I wish on all the people
Who really dream

And I′m wishin' on tomorrow
Praying it′ll come
And I'm wishin′ on all the lovin'
We've ever done

I never thought I′d see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments
That we spent
I just can′t let you go
For me, you were meant

And I didn't mean to hurt you
But I know
That in the game of love
You reap what you sow

I feel it′s time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
Make the best of things, oh baby
When we′re together, oh oh oh
Whether or never

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it′s time for us to get back together
Make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never

I'm wishin′ on a star
To follow where you are
I′m wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows
That I see
I wish on all the people
We′ll never be

And I'm hopin′ on all the days to come
And days to go
And I'm hopin′ on days of lovin' you so, oh oh oh

Wishin' on a star
Follow where you are
Wishin′ on a star
And I wish on all the rainbows
That I see
I′m wishing on a star
I'm wishing on a star

I′m wishing on a star
Follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star
I′m wishing on a star
I'm wishing on a star
