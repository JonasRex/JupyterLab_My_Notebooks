Hey (what?)
Turn it off (dad, this is the best part)
Turn it off (no)It′s too late for this, turn it off
(Dad, this is the best part, come on)
No, turn it off now
(No, this is, I wanna listen to it okay?)
'Cause it′s too loud and disturbs the neighbors, turn it off now

Yeah right, too late? Sure, eat this

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
We're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But if you're thinking about my baby
It don′t matter if you′re black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them, I ain't second to none
And I told ′em 'bout equality
And it′s true, either you're wrong or you′re right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don′t matter if you′re black or white

I'm tired of this devil
I′m tired of this stuff
I'm tired of this business
Oh, when the going gets rough
I ain′t scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain′t scare of nobody
Go, when you're gonna get mean

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I′d rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it′s not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I′m not gonna spend my life being a color

Do you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye?

But, if you're thinkin′ about my baby
It don't matter if you′re black or white
I said, if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don′t matter if you′re black or white
I said, if you're thinkin′ of being my brother
It don't matter if you′re black or white

Alright, alright (ooh, ooh)
Alright (yeah, yeah, yeah now)
Alright, alright (ooh, ooh)
Shamone (yeah, yeah, yeah now)
Alright

It's black, it′s white
It's tough for you to be black (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it′s white (woo!)
It′s black, it's white
It′s tough for you to be black (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it′s white (woo!)
