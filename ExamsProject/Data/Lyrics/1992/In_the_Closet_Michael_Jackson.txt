There′s something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presenceI′m so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who′s doin′ me by
Is it worth the giving? Is it worth the try?
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it) dare me
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it, yeah
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)

It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can′t neglect it, you can't abuse it
It′s just desire, you cannot waste It
Then if you want it, then won't you taste it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it) dare me
(She wants to give it, ah, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets, make your move, set me free

Ah, because there′s something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby

Just promise me whatever we say (and we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow to just (never knew)
Keep it in the closet

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can′t deny
It′s just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it′s aching, you have to rub it

She wants to give it

This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you′ll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there′s something about you, baby

Keep it in the closet
