I′ve been watching you for a long time
You look so good, got my eyes on you

Verse 1:
I've been watching you
For so very long.
Trying to get my nerves built up
To be so strong.
I really want to meet you
But I′m kinda scared.
Cause your the kind of lady
With so much class.
I get my thoughts together
For the very next day.
But when I see you lady
I forget what to say.
Your eyes and hair
Such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk,
It really turns me on.
Oh yeah you really turn me on
Come on, come on, come on.

Chorus:
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you
I really wanna know you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Verse 2:
There you are again
With the same smile on each day
I wanna know what it is
That makes me feel this way

I wish I could grab you
Tell you what it means to me
To see you walking my way
It really makes my day
Before I go to sleep
And dream about you
I'm a single man
I hope that you are single too
Why do I seek
Something to set my mind free
Cause curiosity is bugging
The hell out of me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me baby

Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you
I really wanna know you
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
