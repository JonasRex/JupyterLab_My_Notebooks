Let the rhythm ride you, guide you, sneak inside you, set your mind to
Move to its′ pulsation, bass vibrations, synth sensation
Pause is not a place in mind and body must be free to
Please take it all in, nothing to lose, everything to win
Let it control you, hold you, mold you back to order
New touch, it taste, it free your soul and let it face you
Got to be what you wanna, if the groove don't get you, the rifle′s gonna
I'm serious as cancer when I say rhythm is a dancer

Rhythm is a dancer
It′s a soul's companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us

Rhythm, you can feel it, you can feel it
Rhythm, rhythm is a dancer
Rhythm, you can feel it, you can feel it
Rhythm, rhythm is a dancer
