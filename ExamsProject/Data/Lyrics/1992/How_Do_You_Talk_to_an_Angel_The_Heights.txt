I hear her voice in my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soulI don′t know where to start

Tell me tell me
The words to define
The way I fell about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

At night I dream
That she is there
And I can feel her in the air

Tell me tell me
The words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It′s like trying to catch a falling star

How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star
