(Mornings alone)
Oh-oh-oh (When you come home I breathe a little faster)
Every time we′re together, oh-oh
It'd never be the same (It′d never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away (How can you stay)
Away so long? (Away so long?)
Why can't we stay together? Oh-oh
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason!

′Cause I, I don′t want to say it's
I don′t want to find another way
To make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It′s just another day without you
It's just another day, oh-oh

Making the time
(Find the right lines) To make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you?
I′m just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Oh-oh
Give us a chance to make it, to make it (give us a chance to make it)
No, no, no

Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong!
I′m not that strong!

I, I don′t want to say it's
I don′t want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
No-oh!
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It′s just another day without you
No-oh!

I, I, I
I, I, I

Ooh why can't you stay forever?
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason!

′Cause I, no! (I, I don't want to say it's)
(I don′t want to find another)
Don′t want to find a way (Way)
(Make it through the day without you)
Don't want to make it through the day, no!
(I, I, I can′t resist)
Baby, no! (Trying to find exactly what I missed)
(It's just another day without you)
I, I, I yeah!

(I, I don′t want to say it's)
Don′t want to find a way no! (I don't want to find another way)
(Make it through the day without you)
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, no, no! No, no, no! no, no, no (I, I can't resist)
No, no, no! Oh yeah (Trying to find exactly what I missed)
(It′s just another day without you)
