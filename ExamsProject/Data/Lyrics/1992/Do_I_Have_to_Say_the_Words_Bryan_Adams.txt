Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me, darling, rescue meWith your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me, darling, rescue me
When this world′s closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free, darling, rescue me, oh

I don′t wanna let you go, so I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me, please, darling, rescue me
Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can′t you see? Darling, rescue me, yeah

I don′t wanna let you go, so I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I′m needing you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?
Yeah!

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

So good together, yeah
