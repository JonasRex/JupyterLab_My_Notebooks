My eyes are clouded
By the ghosts of a different life
When as a soldierI fought and cursed and cried
And now they′re staring
At a table brown and bare
And they're searching
For something that ain′t there

As the waitress comes and brings me another round
I don't say a word, I just stare down at the ground
Girl, whatever it is you're thinking
Don′t you look at me that way

Just keep on walkin′
My mind's a thousand miles away
And I ain′t talking
About what brought me here today
I just wanna be alone in a crowded room
Jukebox belting out songs about lovin' and drinkin′
Is that such a sin

Said she was leaving
'Cause I wasn′t the same man
And she took our children
'Cause she thinks that's right for them
Now I wonder
If I sit here long enough
Will I discover
Why I find it so damn tough

To grab the man I was
And turn him into me
Be the husband the father the friend
That I should be
Lord knows it′s right
But it′s trapped too deep inside

So I keep on walkin'
My heart′s a thousand miles away
And ain't no talking
Gonna take this hurt away
I wanna be somewhere in a room with you,
Dancin′ in the way we used to do
But I keep on walkin'

I′ve been trapped inside these walls I've built of silence
I can't let you in although I have been tryin′
I know what you want
But I can′t do it
Ain't got strength enough
To get me through it
Been holding on too long to let it go
God knows

But let′s go walkin'
You′ve got my heart right in your hand
And if we're talkin′
Maybe there's a chance
Of dancin' once again in a crowded room
Jukebox joining as we dream ′bout lovin′ and livin'
′Cause I won't give in
Let′s keep on walkin'
