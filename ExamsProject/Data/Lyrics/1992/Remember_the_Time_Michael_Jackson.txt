Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were young and innocent thenDo you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the fall (I bet you remember)
We′d be together all day long (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Us holding hands (I bet you remember)
In each other's eyes, we′d stare (I bet you remember)
Tell me

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I′ll never let you go"

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the spring? (I bet you remember)
Every morning, birds would sing (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Those special times? (I bet you remember)
They′ll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time? (Do you remember?)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)

Do you remember the time? ('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time? (All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)

Remember the time (Ooh!)
Remember the time
Do you remember, girl?
Remember the time
On the phone, you and me
Remember the time
′Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?

Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you?
Remember the time (Do you, do you?)
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
Remember the time

Remember the time
Ooh! In the park
Remember the time
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
Remember the time (Do you, do you)
Do you, did you?
Remember the time
Yeah, yeah, woo!
Remember the time, remember the time
