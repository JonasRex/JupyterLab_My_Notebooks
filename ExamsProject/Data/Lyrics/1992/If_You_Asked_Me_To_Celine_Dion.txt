Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It′s been a long time since I've had that feelingI could love someone
I could trust someone
I said, "I′d never let nobody near my heart again darling"
I said, "I'd never let nobody in" but

If you asked me to (if you asked me to)
I'd just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to (if you asked me to)
I′d just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to
Ba-ba-ba-baby, oh, yeah

Somehow ever since I′ve been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can′t help feeling darlin' since i′ve found you
That I've found my home
That I′m finally home
I said, "I'd never let nobody get too close to me darling"
I said, "I needed, needed to be free"

But if you asked me to (if you asked me to)
I'd just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to (if you asked me to)
I′d just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to (if you asked me to)
If, if you-

Ask me to, I will give my world to you, baby
I need you now (I need you know)
Ask me to and I′ll do anything (anything)
For you baby, for you baby

(If you asked me to)
I'll let you in my life forever
(If you asked me to)
All you gotta do is ask me to
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do is ask me to

(If you asked me to)
I′d give you my world
I'd give you my heart
Everything, everything baby

(If you asked me to)
Just ask me to
I think you want ask me what to do-do-do
Just ask me to
(If you asked me to)
I′d change my mind
I'd change my mind
