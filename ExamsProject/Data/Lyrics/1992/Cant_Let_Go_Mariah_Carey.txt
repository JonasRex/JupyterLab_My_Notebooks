There you are
Holding her hand
I am lostDyin′ to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don′t you know
You were my life

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can′t let go

Just cast aside
You don′t even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don′t care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone (no, no)

Even though I try
I can′t let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can′t let go

Do you even realize
The sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try
To deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

Even though I try
I can't let go (no, no, I just can't get you out of my mind)
Something in your eyes (I never can say goodbye)
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You′re all I know
I can′t let you go

Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night
I see you in my dreams
You′re all I know
I can't let go
