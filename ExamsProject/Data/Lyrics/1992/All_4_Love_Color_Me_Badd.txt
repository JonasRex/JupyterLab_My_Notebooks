I′m so glad you're my girl, I′ll do anything for you
Call you every night and give you flowers too
I thank the lord for you and think about you all the timeAnd ask him every day that you'll forever be mine

(I wanna hold your hand) To show you I'll be there
(I like to do the things) That let you know I care
(I sing this lullaby) ′Cause girl, you fill me full
(I look into your eyes) You′re so beautiful

Oh girl, I think I love you
I'm always thinking of you
I want you to know I do it all for love
I love it when we′re together
Girl, I need you forever
And I want you to know I do it all for love

I will never leave you, sugar, this I guarantee
I look into the future, I see you and me
Knight in shining armor, I will be your fairytale
I wanna take care of you, girl, I'll serve you well

(I will be there for you) To catch you when you fall
(I′ll hold you in my arms) That's where you belong
(I sing this lullaby) ′Cause girl, you fill me full
(I look into your eyes) You're so beautiful, beautiful, yeah

Oh girl, I think I love you
I'm always thinking of you
I want you to know I do it all for love
I love it when we′re together
Girl, I need you forever
And I want you to know I do it all for love

Now come here, sweetheart
I want you to know something, alright?
Ya see everyday in my life without you
Would be like a hundred years
The distance between us, the ocean of tears
See all the things I do for you are for love, dig it

(All for loving) All for love
(All for you) You, you, you
(All for loving you, you) You

Oh girl, I think I love you
I′m always thinking of you
I want you to know I do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
I want you to know I do it all for love

Oh girl, I think I love you
I′m always thinking of you
I want you to know I do it all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
And I want you to know I do it all for love

Oh girl, I think I love you
I′m always thinking of you
All for love
I love it when we're together
Girl, I need you forever
