Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four three
Two, oneInjection fellas

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (don′t worry 'bout a thing baby)
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (just let me love you)

In a minute we′ll be finished
Was I all that you hoped and dreamed?
Was I strong enough (strong enough)?
To make you feel me, did I dig too deep
In your mind?
You were thinking of ways to make me work
For something we both wanted
All through the night, all I heard you say was

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'?
Should we talk about it, baby
You look so beautiful like this
With the moonlight shining on you
What has come over me?
Oh, it feels so good, oh you feel so good
(Let′s do it again)

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (oh c′mon baby)
Uhh ahh (oh I need you tonight baby)
Baby, baby

Uhh ahh (oh, oh come a little)
Uhh ahh (closer to me, baby)
Come closer to show all
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (oh yeah)

Toss and turn
Back and forth
The love goes as the night flows
Every so smoothly
I move you as you groove me
Taking our time as our bodies join
To extract pure satisfaction
Holding and moulding while I'm watching your reactions
To pure bliss, as I rub and kiss
Every pleasure kept from moments like this

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (oh what I′ll do)
Uhh ahh (is make you feel)
(Like no other man)
Uhh ahh (has made you feel)
Uhh ahh

Uhh ahh (I wanna let you know, you have been lookin' for love)
Uhh ahh (for the affection you need)
(You have to look no further)
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

Uhh ahh (because love is, yeah)
Uhh ahh (because love)
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh (yeah, come on girl)

Uhh ahh (come on girl, baby)
Uhh ahh (okay babe)
Uhh ahh (come on)
Uhh ahh (yeah)

Uhh ahh
