No, no, no, baby (hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
(Ooh, look into my eyes) Na, na, na, na, na, na
(Would I lie to you baby?) Would I lie to you?
(Would I lie to you?)

Look into my eyes
Can′t you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you, oh yeah?
Don′t you know it's true
Girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you baby, yeah?

Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I′ve hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it′s open, I can't do no more

I′m telling you baby
You will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh

Look into my eyes (look into my eyes)

Girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
Come on

Everybody's got their history (history)
On every page, a mystery (it′s a mystery)
You can read my diary, you′re in every line (la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Jealous minds (jealous minds) are never satisfied (satisfied)

I'm telling you baby
You will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
(In this heart of mine) Wooh

Look into my eyes (look into my eyes)
Can′t you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you baby?

(Would I lie to you? Would I lie to you, oh yeah?)

(Ooh, look into my eyes) Yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, would I lie to you, baby?)
(Would I lie to you?)

(Trust me, now)
(Trust me, baby)
(Trust me, now)
(Trust me, baby)

(Would I lie to you?)
I wanna see you night and day
(Would I lie?)
And tell you that I'm here to stay
(Would I lie to you?)
Do you think I'd give my love away?
(Would I lie?)
That′s not the kind of game I play

I′m telling you baby
You will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
In this heart of mine, deep in my heart (whoo)

Look into my eyes (look into my eyes)
Can't you see they′re open wide?
Would I lie to you baby?
