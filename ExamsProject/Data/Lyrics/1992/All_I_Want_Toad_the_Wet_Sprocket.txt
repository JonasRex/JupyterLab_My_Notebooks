nothing's so loud as hearing when we lie the truth is not kind and you've said neither am i         but the air outside so soft is saying everything         everything  all i want is to feel this way to be this close, to feel the same all i want is to feel this way the evening speaks, i feel it say...  nothing's so cold as closing the heart when all we need is to free the soul but we wouldn't be that brave i know         and the air outside so soft, confessing everything         everything  and it won't matter now whatever happens to me though the air speaks of all we'll never be it won't trouble me  and it feels so close let it take me in let it hold me so i can feel it say...
