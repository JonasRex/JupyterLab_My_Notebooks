Nothing′s so loud
As hearing when we lie
The truth is not kindAnd you've said, neither am I

And the air outside′s so soft
Is saying everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave. I know

And the air outside′s so soft
Confessing everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

And it won′t matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won′t trouble me

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

(All I want is to feel this way) it feels so close
(To be this close, to feel the same) let it take me in
(All I want is to feel this way) let it hold me, so
(The evening speaks, I feel it say) I can feel it say
