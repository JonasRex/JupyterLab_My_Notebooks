Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party,
they had the liquor overflowin' the cup,
about 5-6 strippers tryin to work for a buck,
then I took one girl outside wit me,
her name was Lanna, she went to Jr. High wit me,
I said, Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole lots changed since I seen you last
She said,
chorus:
what would you do if your son was at home,
cryin' all alone on the bedroom foor'
cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to sleep wit a man for a 
little bit of money and his daddy's gone,
somewhere smokin' rock now,
in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
so for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life, mmm
girl you ain't the only one wit a baby,
that's no escuse to be livin' all crazy,
then she looked me right square in the eye
and said every day I wake up hopin' to die,
she said-nigga I know about pain cuz,
me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us,
before I was a teenager I done been through more sh-shit,
you can't even relate ta...
(repeat chorus)
Hold up!
what would you do?
get up on my feet let go of every escuse
what would you do?
cuz I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
(come on)
what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop makin' tired escuses
What would you do?
girl I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it
Oooo,Oooo,Oooo
(repeate chorus) 
what would you do if your son was at home,
cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor cuz he's hungry,
and the only way to feed him is to sleep wit a man for a little bit of money
and his daddy's gone, somewhere smokin' rock now, 
in and out of lock down I ain't got a job now,
so for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life (come 
on)
(repeat chorus)
