I stepped on the spot out my CLK 
Just dropped some dollars 
Cop some Prada 
Cuz I just got paid 
I keep the dough 
Stack the flows 
Like it ain't no thang 
And Arista is the label 
That pays me 
Got beats 
That'll drive ya'll crazy 
My shhhh is fly ya'll can plainly see 
My hair be tight my nails be right 
That's why ya'll hate on me 
But while ya'll hatin fellas waitin' 
To get in my face 
Just take a sip on whatever ya'll drinkin' 
Cop a spot on the floor, start freakin' 

I do 
Got the shhhh that'll straight entice you 
Bob ya head make ya feel like 
I do 
If you think you can roll 
Wit an iced out lady ballin' outta control 
I do 
Got the shhhh that'll straight entice you 
Bob ya head make ya feel like 
I do 
If you think you can roll 
Wit an iced out lady ballin' outta control 
Arista is the label that pays me 
Got the beats that'll drive ya'll crazy well 

So what you doin' up in VIP 
Red cardinal cocked 
Fresh ghetto locks 
And got your hands on me 
The way you hold me boy 
I know your likein' what you see 
So now I'm feelin' what you bringin' 
Pull the 2ways out be beamin
