Memories are just where you laid them 
Dragging the waters til the depths give up their dead 
What did you expect to find 
Was it something you left behind 
Don't you remember anything I said when I said, 

[Chorus:]
Don't fall away and leave me to myself 
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
And leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands 
Love lies bleeding 

Oh hold me now I feel contagious 
Am I the only place that you've left to go 
She cries her life is like 
Some movie in black and white 
Dead actors faking lines, over and over and over again she cries 

[Chorus]

And I watched as you turned away 
You don't remember, but I do 
You never even tried 

Don't fall away and leave me to myself 
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again 
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again, oh
