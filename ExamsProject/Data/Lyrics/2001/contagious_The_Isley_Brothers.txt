[R. Kelly] 
There was a story 
About a man comin' in 
Finding his woman in bed wit' 
Well, listen 

[Isleys]
It's 2 a.m., just getting in 
About to check my message 
No one has called but my homies 
And some bill collectors 
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money 
I two-way her, she don't hit me back 
Something is funny 

So I called her mother's house 
And asked her, had she seen my baby 
Drove my 6 around looking for that missing lady 
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news 
And I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused 

And then I turned the TV down 
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound 
Umm, something's going on upstairs, yeah 
Cuz I know nobody else lives here 

As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear 
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear 
Screaming out 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got (Then a man said) 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 
(All I heard was my baby's voice screamin') 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got 
(Then I heard another man, yeah) 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 
(And I just can't believe this shit) 

I ran downstairs, looked in the closet 
Looking for that, ooh 
Said a prayer, cause only God knows what I'm gonna do 
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild 
I'm in the hall contemplating, not in my own damn house 
Who would of thought she was creeping with another man 
The down low happening to me all over again 

And then I turned the TV down 
Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound 
Something going on up there, upstairs 
Cuz I know ain't no one else lives here 

As I get closer to the stairways all I hear 
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear 
Screaming

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got (Then a man says) 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 
(All I can do is hear them say) 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 
(Oh, I can't believe this shit) 

[Mr. Biggs]	What the hell is going on 
		Between the sheets in my home 
[Chante]	Baby wait, let me explain 
		Before you start to point your cane 
[Mr. Biggs]	Girl I'm 'bout to have a fit 
[R. Kelly]	Oh, it's about to be some shit 
		How did I get into this 
		Shoulda never came home with this bitch 
[Mr. Biggs]	You low down dirty woman 
		Back to where you come from 
[Chante]	But baby, wait 
[Mr. Biggs]	But wait my ass 
		Hit the streets, yo' ass is grass 
[R. Kelly]	Now Mr. Biggs, before you done 
[Mr. Biggs]	Wait, how you know my name son? 
[Chante]	Honey wait, I was gonna tell you 
[Mr. Biggs]	Ooh, this cat looks real familiar 
		Hmm, now don't I know you 
		From somewhere a long time ago 
[R. Kelly]	No no, I don't think so 
[Mr. Biggs]	Yeah yeah, I feel I know you brother, very well 
[R. Kelly]	No no, you're mistaking me for somebody else 
[Chante]	Frank 
[Mr. Biggs]	Shutup, can't you see two men are talking 
[Chante]	But 
[Mr. Biggs]	Thought I told your ass to get to walking 
		Now I think ya'll better leave this place 
		Cause I'm about to catch a case 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got 
(Whoa, that's what she said) 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 
(And then he replied) 

You're contagious, touch me baby 
Give me what you got 
Sexy lady, drive me crazy 
Drive me wild 

Repeat above while: 
I should have known from the shopping spree 
And all the time you smiled at me 
And making love girl, never the same 
I can tell how you said my name
