Fall Fall Fall 
uh uh uh 
I keep fallin' in out of love wit you 
Sometimes I love you 
Sometimes I'm blue 
Sometimes I glow inside 
Other times u make me cry 
Tell me what am I to do 
I'm so confused 
Tell me who tell me what tell me when 
Tell me when Tell me when tell me how 
Tell me who tell me what tell me when 
Tell me when Tell me why 
I keep on fallin in and out wit you 
I never love someone like you 
I'm fallin in and out of love wit you 
I never way that I love you 

O O 
I never felt this way 
Tell me why I feel this way 
How do you give me such pleasure and pain 
And when i think I'll take it all 
And anywho can draw 
That is when I start to fall 
Tell me who tell me what tell me when 
Tell me what tell me when tell me when 
Tell me how tell me who tell me what 
Tell me when tell me why 

I keep on fallin in and out of love with you 
I never loved someone like you 
i'm fallin with you 
I never way that i love you
