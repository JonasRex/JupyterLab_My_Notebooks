[Ja Rule] 
Murda Inc, ha, ha 
It, must, be the ASS - that got me like damn 
If they get any fatter 
Man the Rule gonna have to get at her 
And our situation won't matter 
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners 
J to the L-O, hello 
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald 
I'm the Rule and the shot call 
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days 
It's the Inc. and Lopez now 

[Jennifer Lopez] 
Ain't it funny 
It's been awhile since you came around 
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down 
Tryin' to tell me why ya want my time 
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind 
See it never had to be this way 
You should've never played the games you played 
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame 
Knowin how the situation change 

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez] 
Ain't that funny 
Baby that you want me 
When you had me 
Love is crazy 
Now I can smile and say 
Ain't that funny 
Baby that you want me 
When you had me 
Love is crazy 
I'm glad I can smile and say 
Ain't that funny 

[Jennifer Lopez] 
I remember how you walked away 
Even when I tried to call your name 
See at first I didn't understand 
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man 
I remember how you did me wrong 
And now you're hurtin' cause my love is gone 
Everybody gets a chance to burn 
You can take it as a lesson learned 

[Chorus]

[Cadillac Tah] 
C-A double D, HA!!! 
Double dose ma 
Fly by, red line, Testa Rossa 
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha 
Spit the ism, hit 'em, get rid of em 
And you know Tah get it gully 
And ain't that funny 
How they want me see me workin' with money 
But Caddy ain't a dummy 
What these brodies want from me 
Cause all I got is G, J.LO!!! 
And Murda I.N.C. 

[Jennifer Lopez] 
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts 
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce 
Tryin' to blind me with your blingin' bling 
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing 
Hope you realize that now I'm through 
And I don't ever wanna hear from you 
I had enough of bein' there for you 
Now I'm laughin' why you play the fool 

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule] 
Baby, is that your girlfriend 
I got my boyfriend 
But maybe we can be friends 
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
Baby, I've got my boyfriend 
Is that your girlfriend 
But maybe we can be friends 
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 

[Chorus to fade]
