[Verse 1 (Brian):]
I'm rolling down a lonely highway asking god to please forgive me for messing up tha blessing he gave to me, i see,
Everything clearer now the nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, imma lose it, i pray that he would just shed his grace on me, i need just to be back with my baby

[Chorus:]
Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, gotta get right wit you
Feel like i just walked right out of heaven
Feel like i have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea 
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Dont know what to do, feel like i just walk right out of heaven

[Verse 2 (Brandon):]
See my mamma told me thats if its meant to be she'll come back and she'll forgive me and the best thing i can do it to just
Let her, let her go i know, i don't wanna do it
But if i continue to push she'll just pull away and i know that in my heart its a reality i didn't treat her like she wanted
To be treated, and i hope that shes not gone for good no no

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1:]
Hey girl waiting for you all the time, suppose to move on with my life, and girl i tried and i tried
I feel like i can't walk, i feel like i can't talk girl i dont know what to do get back right with you i feel like i just
Walked outta heaven

[Bridge 2 (Wingo):]
If u ever loved somebody, and if you ever had somebody, but you know that you hurt that somebody, let me here you say yea

[Chorus (repeat till fade)]
