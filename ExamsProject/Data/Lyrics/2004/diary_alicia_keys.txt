[Verse 1:]

Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feelin'
No one but me and you

[Hook:]

I wont tell, your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Verse 2:]

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Oooh baby if there is anything that you fear 
Call 489 4608 and I'll be here

[Hook 2:]

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Bridge:]

Only we know what is talked about, Baby boy
I don't know how you could be driving me so crazy
Baby when you're in town
Why don't you come around 
I'll be the loyalty you need
You can trust me

[Hook and out]
