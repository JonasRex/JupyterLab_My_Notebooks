He-ey, He-e-e-e-ey, He-e-e-e-ey,
Your lipstick stains, 
On the front lobe of my left side brains,
I knew I wouldn't forget you,
And so I went and let you blow my mind,
Your sweet moving,
The smell of you in every single dream I dream,
I knew when we collided,
You're the one I have decided,
Who's one of my kind.

Hey soul sister,
Ain't that mister mister on the radio,
Stereo, the way you move ain't fair you know,
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do,
Tonight.

He-ey, He-e-e-e-ey, He-e-e-e-ey,
Just in time,
I'm so glad you have a one track mind like me,
You gave my life direction,
Against your love connection,
You can't deny-y-y-y-y-y-y-y,
I'm so obsessed,
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest,
I believe in you,
Like a virgin you're madonna,
And I'm always gonna want to blow your mind.

Hey soul sister,
Ain't that mister mister on the radio,
Stereo, the way you move ain't fair you know,
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do,
Tonight.

The way you can cut a rug,
Watching you's the only drug I need,
So gangster I'm so thug,
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see,
I can be myself now finally,
In fact there's nothing I can't be,
I want the world to see you be,
With me.

Hey soul sister,
Ain't that mister mister on the radio,
Stereo, the way you move ain't fair you know,
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight,
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do,
Tonight.

He-ey, He-e-e-e-ey, He-e-e-e-ey,
Tonight,
He-ey, He-e-e-e-ey, He-e-e-e-ey,
Tonight.
