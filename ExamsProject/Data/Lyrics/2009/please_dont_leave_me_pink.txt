Da da da da da,

I dont know if i can yell any louder,
How many times have i kicked you outer here?
Or said something insulting?

Da da da da da

I can be so mean when i wanna be,
I am capable of realy anything,
I could cut you into peices,
But my heart is, broken.

Da da da da da

Please dont leave me [x2]
I always say how i dont need you
But its always gonna come right back to this
Please dont leave me

How did i become so obnoxious,
What is it with you that makes me act like this,
Ive neva been this nasty,
Cant you tell that this is just a contest,
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest,
But baby i dont mean it,
I mean it, I promise

Da da da da da

Please dont leave me [x2]
I always say how i dont need you
But its always gonna come right back to this
Please dont leave me

I forgot to say outloud,
How beautiful you really are to me,
I cant be without,
Your my perfect little punching bag,
And i need you,
Im sorry.

Please, please dont leave me
Baby please dont leave me (No, dont leave me)
Please dont leave me 
I always say how i dont need you
But its always gonna come right back to this
Please dont leave me (No, Dont leave me)

I always say how i dont need you,
But its always gonna come right back to this,
Please dont leave me,

Please, Please dont leave me.
