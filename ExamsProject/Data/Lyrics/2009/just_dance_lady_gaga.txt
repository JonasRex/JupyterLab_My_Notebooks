A red one
Convict
Gaga

I've had a little bit too much
All of the people start to rush.
Start to rush by.
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys, I lost my phone.
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.

[Chorus:]
Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Spin that record babe.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Duh-duh-duh-duh
Dance. Dance. Dance. Just dance.

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out, right.
Control your poison babe
Roses have thorns they say.
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.

[Chorus]

[Colby O'Donis]
When I come through on the dance floor checking out that catalogue.
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw.

And I ain't gonna' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like a call
I'm gonna hit it, I'm gonna hit it and flex and do it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty i can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips round and round
There's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay, let me watch you break it down.

[Chorus]

Half Psychotic, Sick hypnotic got my blueprint its symphonic.
Half Psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.
Half Psychotic, Sick hypnotic got my blueprint its symphonic.
Half Psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.

Go. Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
I got it, just stay close enough to get it
Don't slow! Drive it, clean it lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough
(I got it)
In your Pocko
(I got it)

[Chorus]
