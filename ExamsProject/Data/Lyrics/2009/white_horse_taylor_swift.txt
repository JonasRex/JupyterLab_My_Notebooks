Say you're sorry that face of an angel comes out just when you need it to
As I pace back and forth all this time 'cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you ever let me down
Now it's too late for you on your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes, I never really had a chance
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you ever let me down
Now it's too late for you on your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is the big world, that was a small town
There in the rearview mirror disappear and now
Now it's too late for you on your white horse
Now it's too late for you on your white horse to catch me now
Oh, ohh, try and catch me now
Ohh, it's too late to catch me now
