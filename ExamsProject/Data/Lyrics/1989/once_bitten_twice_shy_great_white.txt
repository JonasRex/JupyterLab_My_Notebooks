(Hunter)
Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock-n-roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock-n-roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
My my my, once bitten, twice shy babe
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home from messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock-n-roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
I didn't know you had a rock-n-roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now it's dark and you're gone
My my my, once bitten, twice shy
