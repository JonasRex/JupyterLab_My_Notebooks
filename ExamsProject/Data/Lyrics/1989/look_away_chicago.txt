When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found, 
I'm said ";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you."; 
Found someone else, 
I guess I won't be coming 'round. 
I guess it's over, baby; 
it's really over, baby, whoa... 
And from what you said 
I know you've gotten over me; 
it'll never be the way it used to be. 
So if it's gotta be this way, 
don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay. 
But if you see me walking by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
When we both agreed as lovers, 
we were better off as friends, 
that's how it had to be, 
yeah, that's how it had to be. 
I tell you I'm fine 
but sometimes I just pretend; 
wish you were holding me, 
wish you were still holding me, whoa... 
I just never thought, 
that I would be replaced so soon; 
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. 
I know I wanted to be free; 
yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. 
But if you see me waling by, 
and the tears are in my eyes, 
look away, baby, look away. 
If we meet on the streets someday, 
and I don't know what to say, 
look away, baby, look away. 
Don't look at me; 
I don't want you to see me this way. 
[Repeat chorus 2x] 
When you called me up this morning, 
told me 'bout the new love you found. 
I said ";I'm happy for you, 
I'm really happy for you.";
