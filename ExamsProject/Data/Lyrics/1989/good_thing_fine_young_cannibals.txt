The one good thing in my life
Has gone away I don't know why
She's gone away I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her 

The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone 

Good thing where have you gone
Good thing you've been gone too long
Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo 

People say I should forget
There's plenty more don't get upset
People say she's doin' fine
Mutual friends I see sometime 

That's not what I want to hear
I want to hear she wants me near 

Good thing where have you gone
Good thing you've been gone too long
Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo 

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room
Caught me dreaming like a fool 

Good thing where have you gone
Good thing you've been gone too long
Hey hey hey woo hoo hoo
