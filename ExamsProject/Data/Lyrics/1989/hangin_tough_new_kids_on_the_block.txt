Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Listen up everybody if you wanna take a chance. 
[Rap:] Just get on the floor and do the New Kids' dance. 
Don't worry 'bout nothing 'cause it won't take long. 
[Rap:] We're gonna put you in a trance with a funky song, 'cause you gotta be 
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough. 
[Rap:] We're rough. 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Everybody's always talkin' 'bout who's on top. 
[Rap:] Don't cross our path 'cause you're gonna get stomped. 
We ain't gonna give anybody any slack. 
[Rap:] And if you try to keep us down we're gonna come right back, 
and you know we're 
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough. 
[Rap:] Are you tough enough 
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough. 
[Rap:] We're rough. 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
Get loose everybody 'cause we're gonna do our thing. 
[Rap:] 'Cause you know it ain't over 'till the fat lady sings. 
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough. 
[Rap:] Are you tough enough 
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough. 
[Rap:] We're rough. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just hangin' tough, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hangin' tough.
