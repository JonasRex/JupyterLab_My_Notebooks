I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you got in mind
'Cause we're running outta time
Won't you ever set me free
This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy (ooh ooh)
Like no one else (ooh ooh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (ooh ooh)

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy (ooh ooh)
Like no one else (ooh ooh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (ooh ooh)

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy (ooh ooh)
Like no one else (ooh ooh)
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself (ooh ooh)
