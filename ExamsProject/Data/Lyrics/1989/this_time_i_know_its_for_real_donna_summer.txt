What would I have to do
to get you to notice me too
do I
stand in line
one of a million
admiring eyes
Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
when I get my hands on you I won't let go
this time I know it's for real
Should I write or call your home
shout it out with a megaphone
radio, TV news
got to find a way
to get my message to you
To say I love you with a neon sign
anything to make you mine
I'm going crazy just to let you know
if I wait too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
that this time I know it's for real
Oh baby
this time, this time, this time, this time
oh baby
this time, this time
Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
when I get my hands on you I won't let go
this time I know it's for real
I'm going crazy just to let you know
if I waited too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
that this time I know it's for real
