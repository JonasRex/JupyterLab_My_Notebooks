Cher and Peter Cetera

Peter Cetera:

Well here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight

Cher:
I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

CHORUS Cher and Peter Cetera:

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After All that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess It's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

Cher:

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

CHORUS Cher and Peter Cetera:

After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After All that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess It's meant to be
Forever you and me, after all

BRIDGE Cher and Peter Cetera:

Always just beyond my touch
You know I need you so much
After all what else is living for

CHORUS(2x)
